When he saw a malefactor resolutely endure his torments, How great a rascal is this fellow, he cried out, that uses patience, bravery, and courage, in such an impious and dishonest case! To one commending an orator for his skill in amplifying petty matters he said, I don't think that shoemaker a good workman that makes a great shoe for a little foot. When one in discourse said to him, Sir, you have assented to such a thing already, and repeated it very often, he replied, Yes, if it is right; but if not, I said so indeed but never assented. And the other rejoining, But, sir, a king is obliged to perform whatever he hath granted by his nod; No more, he returned, than those that petition him are bound to make none but good and just requests, and to consider all circumstances of time and what befits a king. When he heard any praise or censure, he thought it as necessary to enquire into the character of those that spake as of those of whom they spake. While he was a boy, at a certain solemnity of naked dancing, the person that ordered that affair put him in a dishonorable place; and he, though already declared king, endured it, saying, I'll show that it is not the places that grace men, but men the places. To a physician prescribing him a nice and tedious course of physic, he said, By <a href="/people_index.php?pid=230" target="_blank">Castor</a> and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=327" target="_blank">Pollux</a>, unless I am destined to live at any rate, I surely shall not if I take all this. Whilst he stood by the altar of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=11" target="_blank">Athena</a> <a href="/people_index.php?pid=4921" target="_blank">Chalcioecus</a> sacrificing an <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10961" target="_blank">ox</a>, a louse bit him. At this he never blushed, but cracked him before the whole company, adding these words, By all the Gods, it is pleasant to kill a plotter at the very altar. Another time seeing a boy pull a <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10966" target="_blank">mouse</a> by the tail out of his hole, and the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10966" target="_blank">mouse</a> turn and bite the boy's fingers and so escape; he bade his companions take notice of it, saying, If so little a creature will oppose injurious violence, what think ye that men ought to do? Being eager for war against the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persians</a> to free the Asiatic Greeks, he consulted the oracle of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1" target="_blank">Zeus</a> at <a about='https://topostext.org/place/395208SDod' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://39.5464,20.7878'>Dodona</a>; and that telling him to go on as he designed, he brought the answer to the Ephors, </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg082.perseus-grc1:2' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

He went, and put it in this form: <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2" target="_blank">Apollo</a>, are you of the same mind with your father? And the oracle agreeing, he was chosen general and the war began. Now <a href="/people_index.php?pid=163" target="_blank">Tissaphernes</a>, at first being afraid of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=51" target="_blank">Agesilaus</a>, came to articles, and agreed that the Greek cities should be free and left to their own laws; but afterward procuring a great army from the king, he declared war against him unless he should presently leave Asia. Glad of this treachery of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=163" target="_blank">Tissaphernes</a>, he marched as if his design was to make an inroad upon <a about='https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.01,28.7'>Caria</a>; but when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=163" target="_blank">Tissaphernes</a> had brought his troops thither, he turned upon <a about='https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40,31'>Phrygia</a>, and took a great many cities and abundance of rich spoil, saying to his friend: To break one's promise is indeed impious; but to outwit an enemy is not only just and glorious, but profitable and sweet. Being inferior to the enemy in <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horse</a>, he retreated to <a about='https://topostext.org/place/379273PEph' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.9419,27.3397'>Ephesus</a>, and ordered all the wealthy to provide each a man and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horse</a>, which should excuse them from personal service in his wars. By which means, in the room of rich cowards, he was soon furnished with stout men and able <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a>; and this he said he did in imitation of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=47" target="_blank">Agamemnon</a>, who agreed for a serviceable mare to discharge a wealthy coward. When he ordered the captives to be sold naked and the chapmen came, a thousand bid money for the clothes, but all derided the bodies of the men, which were tender and white by reason of their delicate breeding, as useless and worth nothing. He said to his soldiers, Look, those are the things for which ye fight, and these are the things with whom ye fight. Having beaten <a href="/people_index.php?pid=163" target="_blank">Tissaphernes</a> in <a about='https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.5,28'>Lydia</a> and killed many of his men, he wasted the territories of the king; and the king sending money and desiring a peace, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=51" target="_blank">Agesilaus</a> replied: To grant peace is in the power only of the commonwealth. I delight to enrich my soldiers rather than myself, and think it agreeable to the honor of the Greeks not to receive gifts from their enemies but to take spoils. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1889" target="_blank">Megabates</a> the son of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1457" target="_blank">Spithridates</a>, a very pretty boy, who thought himself very well beloved, coming to him to offer a kiss and an embrace, he turned away his head. But when the boy had not appeared a long time, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=51" target="_blank">Agesilaus</a> enquired after him; and his friends replied, that it was his own fault, since he derided the kiss of the pretty boy, and the youth was afraid to come again. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=51" target="_blank">Agesilaus</a>, standing silent and musing a pretty while, said: Well, I will use no persuasions, for methinks I had rather conquer such desires than take the most popular city of my enemies; for it is better to preserve our own than rob others of their liberty. In all things else he was very exact, and a strict observer of the law; but in his friends' concerns he thought that to be too scrupulous was a bare pretence to cloak unwillingness to use his interest. And agreeable to this, there is extant a small note of his, interceding for a friend to one <a href="/people_index.php?pid=3861" target="_blank">Idrieus</a> a <a about='https://topostext.org/place/370287RKar' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.01,28.7'>Carian</a>: If <a href="/people_index.php?pid=115" target="_blank">Nicias</a> is not guilty, discharge him; if he is, discharge him for my sake; but by all means pray let him be discharged. This was his usual humor in his friends' concerns, yet sometimes profit and convenience was preferred; for once breaking up his camp in disorder, and leaving one that he loved behind him sick, when he begged and beseeched him with tears to have compassion, he turned and said, How hard it is to be pitiful and wise at once! His diet was the same with that of his attendants; he never fed to satisfy, nor drank himself drunk; he used sleep not as a master, but as a servant to his affairs;</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg082.perseus-grc1:2.209' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

He lodged amongst his soldiers, and his bed was as mean as any; and this he had always in his mouth: It befits a governor to excel private men not in delicacy and softness, but in bravery and courage. And therefore when one asked him what good <a href="/people_index.php?pid=78" target="_blank">Lycurgus</a>'s laws had brought to <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a>, he replied, Contempt of pleasure. And to one that wondered at his and the other <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Lacedemonians</a>' mean fare and poor attire, he said, From this course of life, sir, we reap liberty. And to one advising him to indulge more, saying, Chance is uncertain, and you may never have the opportunity again, he replied, I accustom myself so that, let whatever change happen, I shall need no change. When he was grown old, he continued the same course; and to one asking him why at his age in very cold weather he would not wear a coat, he replied, that the youth may imitate, having the old men and governors for example. The <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.7799,24.7138'>Thasians</a>, when he marched through their country, presented him with corn, geese, sweetmeats, honey-cakes, and all sorts of delicacies, both of meat and drink; he accepted the corn, but commanded them to carry back the rest, as useless and unprofitable to him. But they importunately pressing him to take all, he ordered them to be given to the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=12102" target="_blank">Helots</a>; and when some asked the reason, he replied, They that profess bravery ought not to meddle with such delicacies; and whatever takes with slaves cannot be agreeable to the free. Another time the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408247PTha' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.7799,24.7138'>Thasians</a>, after considerable benefits received, made him a God and dedicated temples to his honor, and sent an embassy to compliment him on that occasion. When he had read over the honors the ambassadors had brought him, Well, said he, and can your country make men Gods? And they affirming, Go to, he rejoined, make yourselves all Gods first; and when that is done, I'll believe you can make me one. The Greeks in Asia decreeing him statues, he wrote thus to them: Let there be no representation of me, either painted, founded, or engraved. In Asia, seeing a house roofed with square beams, he asked the master whether trees in their country were grown square. And he replying, No, but round; What then, said he, if they grew square, would you make them round? Being asked how far <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a>'s bounds extended, shaking a spear he replied, As far as this will reach. And to another enquiring why <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a> was without walls, he showed the citizens in arms, saying, Look, these are the walls of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a>. And to another that put the same question he replied, Cities should be walled not with stones and timber, but with the courage of the inhabitants; and his friends he advised to strive to be rich not in money, but in bravery and virtue. When he would have his soldiers do any thing quickly, he before them all put the first hand to it; he was proud that he wrought as much as any, and valued himself more upon ruling his own desires than upon being king. When one saw a lame <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Spartan</a> marching to the war, and endeavored to procure a <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horse</a> for him, How, said he, don't you know that war needs those that will stay, not those that will fly? Being asked how he got this great reputation, he replied, By contemning death. And another time, one enquiring why the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Spartans</a> used pipes and music when they fought, he said, When all move in measure, it may be known who is brave and who a coward.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg082.perseus-grc1:2.210' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

When he had conquered a great part of Asia, he designed to march against the King himself, to break his quiet and hinder him from corrupting the popular men amongst the Greeks, but being recalled by the Ephors to oppose the designs which the other Greek states, bought with the King's gold, were forming against <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a>, he said, A good ruler should be governed by the laws, — and sailed away from Asia, leaving the Greeks there extremely sorry at his departure. And because the stamp of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persian</a> money was an archer, he said, when he broke up his camp, that he was driven out of Asia by thirty thousand of the King's archers.

And this epistle he sent to the Ephors: AGESILAUS to the EPHORS, Greeting. We have subdued a great part of Asia, driven out the barbarians, and furnished <a about='https://topostext.org/place/375275RIon' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38,27.7'>Ionia</a> with arms. But since you command me back, I follow, nay almost come before this epistle; for I am not governor for myself, but for the commonwealth. And then a king truly rules according to justice, when he is governed by the laws, the Ephors, or others that are in authority in the commonwealth. Passing the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/402264WHel' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.2,26.4'>Hellespont</a>, he marched through <a about='https://topostext.org/place/410265RThr' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://41,26.5'>Thrace</a>, but made no applications to any of the barbarians, only sending to know whether he marched through the country of an enemy or a friend.

But he scoffingly replied, Why then do not you come presently to receive what you demand? And leading on his army, he fought them; and having destroyed a considerable number, he marched through. To the king of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedon</a> he sent the same question; and he replying that he would consider of it, Let him consider, saith he, and we will be marching on.

And yet when he returned, after so much glory and so many victories, he made no alteration in his course of life. When he saw some of the citizens think themselves brave fellows for breeding <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a> for the race, he persuaded his sister Cunisca to get into a chariot and put in for the prize at the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.6378,21.63'>Olympian</a> games, intending by that way to convince the Greeks that it was no argument of bravery, but of wealth and profuse expense. Having <a href="/people_index.php?pid=62" target="_blank">Xenophon</a> the philosopher at his house, and treating him with great consideration, he urged him to send for his children and have them brought up in <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a>, where they might learn the most excellent of arts, how to govern and how to be governed.

When <a href="/people_index.php?pid=107" target="_blank">Lysander</a> was dead, he found a strong faction, which <a href="/people_index.php?pid=107" target="_blank">Lysander</a> upon his return from Asia had associated against him, and was very eager to show the people what manner of citizen <a href="/people_index.php?pid=107" target="_blank">Lysander</a> was whilst he lived. And finding among <a href="/people_index.php?pid=107" target="_blank">Lysander</a>'s papers an oration composed by <a href="/people_index.php?pid=285" target="_blank">Cleon</a> of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/370274PHal' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0323,27.4238'>Halicarnassus</a>, about new designs and changing the government, which <a href="/people_index.php?pid=107" target="_blank">Lysander</a> was to speak to the people, he resolved to publish it. But when an old politician, perusing the discourse and fearing its effect upon the people, advised him not to dig up <a href="/people_index.php?pid=107" target="_blank">Lysander</a> but rather bury the speech with him, he followed the advice, and made no more of it. Those of the contrary faction he did not openly molest, but by cunning contrivance he got some of them into office, and then showed them to be rascals when in power. And then defending them or getting their pardon when accused, he brought them over to his own side, so that he had no enemy at last. To one desiring him to write to his acquaintance in Asia, that he might have justice done him, he replied, My acquaintance will do thee justice, though I do not write. One showed him the wall of a city strongly built and well fortified, and asked him whether he did not think it a fine thing. Yes, by heaven, he replied, for women, but not for men to live in. To a <a about='https://topostext.org/place/380233PMeg' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.997,23.34285'>Megarian</a> talking great things of his city he said, Youth, thy words want an army.

Have not you heard who I am? — he looked upon him and said, Art not thou <a href="/people_index.php?pid=7423" target="_blank">Callipides</a>, the Merry Andrew? (For that is the name the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Lacedemonians</a> give an actor.)

Upon which account <a href="/people_index.php?pid=51" target="_blank">Agesilaus</a> was not at all blemished by this dishonorable treaty; for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=914" target="_blank">Antalcidas</a> was his enemy, and clapped up a peace on purpose because the war raised <a href="/people_index.php?pid=51" target="_blank">Agesilaus</a> and got him glory. When one said, The <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Lacedemonians</a> are becoming medized, he replied, Rather the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://35.5,48'>Medes</a> are becoming laconized. And being asked which was the better virtue, courage or justice, he said: Courage would be good for nothing, if there were no justice; and if all men were just, there would be no need of courage. The Asians being wont to style the king of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persia</a> The Great; How, said he, is he greater than I am, if he is not more just or temperate? And he used to say, The Greeks in Asia are mean-spirited freemen, but stout slaves. And being asked how one might get the greatest reputation amongst men, he replied, By speaking the best and doing the bravest things. And he had this saying commonly in his mouth, A commander should be daring against his enemy, and kind and good-natured to his own soldiers. When one asked him what boys should learn; That, said he, which they shall use when men. When he sat judge upon a cause, the accuser spake floridly and well; but the defendant meanly and ever now and then repeated these words, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=51" target="_blank">Agesilaus</a>, a king should assist the laws. What, said he, dost thou think, if any one dug down thy house or took away thy coat, a mason or a weaver would assist thee? A letter being brought him from the king of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persia</a> by a <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persian</a> that came with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=218" target="_blank">Callias</a> the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Spartan</a>, after the peace was concluded, offering him friendship and kind entertainment, he would not receive it, bidding the messenger tell the king that there was no need to send private letters to him; for if he was a friend to <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a> and meant well to Greece, he would do his best to be his friend; but if he designed upon their liberty, he might know that, though he received a thousand letters from him, he would be his enemy. He was very fond of his children; and it is reported that once toying with them he got astride upon a reed as upon a <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horse</a>, and rode about the room; and being seen by one of his friends, he desired him not to speak of it till he had children of his own.

When <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a> had a great many hired soldiers in pay, and wanted money to carry on the war, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=51" target="_blank">Agesilaus</a>, upon the king of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://27.1,30.7'>Egypt</a>'s desire, went to serve him for money. But the meanness of his habit brought him into contempt with the people of that country; for they, according to their bad notions of princes, expected that the king of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a> should appear like the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persian</a>, gaudily attired. But in a little time he sufficiently convinced them that majesty and glory were to be gotten by prudence and courage. When he found his men discouraged at the number of the enemy (for they were 200,000) and their own fewness, just before the engagement, without any man's privity, he contrived how to encourage them: in the hollow of his left hand he wrote victory, and taking the liver from the priest, he put it into that hand, and held it a pretty while, pretending he was in doubt and perplexity at some appearance, till the characters were imprinted on the flesh; and then he showed it to the soldiers, telling them the Gods gave certain signs of victory by these characters. Upon which, thinking they had sure evidence of good success, they marched resolutely to the battle. When the enemy much exceeded them in number and were making an entrenchment round his camp, and Nectabius, whom then he assisted, urged him to fight; I would not, said he, hinder our enemies from making their number as small as ours. And when the trench was almost drawn round, ordering his army to the space between, and so fighting upon equal terms, with those few soldiers he had he routed and killed abundance of the enemy, and sent home a great treasure. Dying on his voyage from <a about='https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://27.1,30.7'>Egypt</a>, he commanded his attendants not to make any figure or representation of his body; For, said he, if I have done any brave action, that will preserve my memory; if not, neither will a thousand statues, the works of base mechanics. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg082.perseus-grc1:2.214' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

To an orator that said speech was the best thing, he rejoined, You then, when you are silent, are worth nothing. When the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/376227PArg' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.6316,22.7195'>Argives</a>, after they had been once beaten, faced him more boldly than before; on seeing many of the allies disheartened, he said, Courage, sirs! for when we conquerors shake, what do you think is the condition of the conquered? To an ambassador from the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/410250PAbd' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.95,24.9833'>Abderites</a>, after he had ended his long speech, enquiring what answer he should carry to his city, he replied, This: As long as you talked, so long I quietly heard.

To some that told him he was envied by the heirs of the other royal family, Well, said he, their own misfortunes will torment them, and my own and my friends' success besides. When one advised him to give the flying enemy room to run, he said, How shall we fight those that stand to it and resist, if we dare not engage those whom their cowardice makes fly? When one proposed a way to free Greece, well contrived indeed but hard to be brought about, he said, Friend, thy words want an army and a treasure. To one saying, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=26" target="_blank">Philip</a> won't let you set foot upon any other part of Greece, he returned, Sir, we have room enough in our own country. An ambassador from <a about='https://topostext.org/place/410280UPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.971,27.953'>Perinthus</a> to <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Lacedemon</a>, after a long tedious speech, asking what answer he should carry back to the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/410280UPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.971,27.953'>Perinthians</a>, he said, What but this? — that thou couldst hardly find an end to thy talk, and I kept silent. He went by himself ambassador to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=26" target="_blank">Philip</a>; and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=26" target="_blank">Philip</a> saying, What! but one? he replied, I am an ambassador but to one. An old man, observing that the ancient laws were neglected and that new evil customs crept in, said to him, when he was now grown old himself, All things here at <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a> are turned topsy-turvy. He replied with a joke: If it is so, it is agreeable to reason; for when I was a boy, I heard my father say that all things were then topsy-turvy; and he heard his father say the same; and it is no wonder if succeeding times are worse than the preceding; but it is a wonder if they happen to be better, or but just as good. Being asked how a man could be always free, he replied, If he contemns death. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg082.perseus-grc1:5' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

The Ephors saying, You lead but few to <a about='https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.795,22.536'>Thermopylae</a>; They are many, said he, considering on what design we go. And when they again asked him whether he had any other enterprise in his thought, he replied, I pretend to go to hinder the barbarians' passage, but really to die fighting for the Greeks. When he was at <a about='https://topostext.org/place/388225FThe' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.795,22.536'>Thermopylae</a>, he said to his soldiers: They report the enemy is at hand, and we lose time; for we must either beat the barbarian or die ourselves.

And another saying, What, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=212" target="_blank">Leonidas</a>, do you come to fight so great a number with so few? — he returned: If you esteem number, all Greece is not able to match a small part of that army; if courage, this number is sufficient. And to another discoursing after the same manner he said, I have enough, since they are to be killed. When <a href="/people_index.php?pid=56" target="_blank">Xerxes</a> wrote to him thus, Sir, you may forbear to fight against the Gods, but may follow my interest and be lord of all Greece, he answered: If you understood wherein consisted the happiness of life, you would not covet other men's; but know that I would rather die for the liberty of Greece than be a monarch over my countrymen. And <a href="/people_index.php?pid=56" target="_blank">Xerxes</a> writing to him again thus, Send me thy arms, he returned, Come and take them. When he resolved to fall upon the enemy, and his captains of the war told him he must stay till the forces of the allies had joined him, he said: Do you think all those that intend to fight are not here already? Or do you not understand that those only fight who fear and reverence their kings? And he ordered his soldiers so to dine, as if they were to sup in another world. And being asked why the bravest men prefer an honorable death before an inglorious life, he replied, Because they believe one is the gift of Nature, while the other is peculiarly their own. Being desirous to save the striplings that were with him, and knowing very well that if he dealt openly with them none would accept his kindness, he gave each of them privately letters to carry to the Ephors. He desired likewise to save three of those that were grown men; but they having some notice of his design refused the letters. And one of them said, I came, sir, to be a soldier, and not a courier; and the second, I shall be a better man if here than if away; and the third, I will not be behind these, but the first in the fight. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg082.perseus-grc1:51' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

Both these <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10953" target="_blank">dogs</a> he brought out into the public assembly, and setting down some scraps of meat and letting go a hare at the same time, each of the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10953" target="_blank">dogs</a> ran greedily to what they had been accustomed. And the hunter catching the hare, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=78" target="_blank">Lycurgus</a> said: See, countrymen, how these two, though of the same litter, by my breeding them are become very different; and that custom and exercise conduces more than Nature to make things brave and excellent. Some say that he did not bring out two whelps of the same kind, but one a house <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10953" target="_blank">dog</a> and the other a hunter; the former of which (though the baser kind) he had accustomed to the woods, and the other (though more noble) kept lazily at home; and when in public, each of them pursuing his usual delight, he had given a clear evidence that education is of considerable force in raising bad or good inclinations, he said: Therefore, countrymen, our honorable extraction, that idol of the crowd, though from <a href="/people_index.php?pid=4" target="_blank">Hercules</a> himself, profits us little, unless we learn and excrcise all our life in such famous exploits as made him accounted the most noble and the most glorious in the world. When he made a division of the land, giving each man an equal portion, it is reported that some while after, in his return from a journey, as he past through the country in harvest time and saw the cocks of wheat all equal and lying promiscuously, he was extremely pleased, and with a smile said to his companions, All <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a> looks like the possession of many loving brothers who have lately divided their estate. Having discharged every man from his debts, he endeavored likewise to divide all movables equally amongst all, that he might have no inequality in his commonwealth. But seeing that the rich men would hardly endure this open and apparent spoil, he cried down all gold and silver coin, and ordered nothing but iron to be current; and rated every man's estate and defined how much it was worth upon exchange for that money. By this means all injustice was banished <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a>; for none would steal, none take bribes, none cheat or rob any man of that which he could not conceal, which none would envy, which could not be used without discovery, or carried into other countries with advantage. Besides, this contrivance freed them from all superfluous arts; for no merchant, sophist, fortune-teller, or mountebank would live amongst them; no carver, no contriver ever troubled <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a>; because he cried down all money that was advantageous to them, and permitted none but this iron coin, each piece of which was an <a about='https://topostext.org/place/378234PAig' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.75,23.425'>Aigina</a> pound in weight, and less than a penny in value. Designing farther to check all luxury and greediness after wealth, he instituted public meals, where all the citizens were obliged to eat. And when some of his friends demanded what he designed by this institution and why he divided the citizens, when in arms, into small companies, he replied: That they may more easily hear the word of command; and if there are any designs against the state, the conspiracy may join but few; and besides, that there may be an equality in the provision, and that neither in meat nor drink, seats, tables, or any furniture, the rich may be better provided than the poor. When he had by this contrivance made wealth less desirable, it being unfit both for use and show, he said to his familiars, What a brave thing is it, my friends, by our actions to make <a href="/people_index.php?pid=641" target="_blank">Plutus</a> appear (as he is indeed) blind! He took care that none should sup at home and afterwards, when they were full of other victuals, come to the public entertainments; for all the rest reproached him that did not feed with them as a glutton and of too delicate a palate for the public provision; and when he was discovered, he was severely punished. And therefore <a href="/people_index.php?pid=175" target="_blank">Agis</a> the king, when after a long absence he returned from the camp (the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.9718,23.72793'>Athenians</a> were beaten in the expedition), willing to sup at home with his wife once, sent a servant for his allowance; the officers refused, and the next day the Ephors fined him for the fault. The wealthy citizens being offended at these constitutions made a mutiny against him, abused, threw stones, and designed to kill him. Thus pursued, he ran through the market-place towards the temple of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=11" target="_blank">Athena</a> of the Brazen House, and reached it before any of the others; only <a href="/people_index.php?pid=3323" target="_blank">Alcander</a> pursuing close struck him as he turned about, and beat out one eye. Afterward the commonwealth delivered up this <a href="/people_index.php?pid=3323" target="_blank">Alcander</a> to his mercy; but he neither inflicted any punishment nor gave him an ill word, but kindly entertained him at his own house, and brought him to be his friend, an admirer of his course of life, and very well affected to all his laws. Yet he built a monument of this sad disaster in the temple of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=11" target="_blank">Athena</a>, naming it Optiletis, — for the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/387224RDor' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.7,22.4'>Dorians</a> in that country call eyes optiloi. Being asked why he used no written laws, he replied, Because those that are well instructed are able to suit matters to the present occasion. And another time, when some enquired why he had ordained that the timber which roofed the houses should be wrought with the axe only, and the doors with no other instrument but the saw, he answered: That my citizens might be moderate in every thing which they bring into their houses, and possess nothing which others so much prize and value. And hence it is reported that King <a href="/people_index.php?pid=687" target="_blank">Leotychides</a> the First, supping with a friend and seeing the roof curiously arched and richly wrought, asked him whether in that country the trees grew square. And some demanding why he forbade them to war often with the same nation, he replied, Lest being often forced to stand on their defence, they should get experience and be masters of our art. And therefore it was a great fault in <a href="/people_index.php?pid=51" target="_blank">Agesilaus</a>, that by his frequent incursions into <a about='https://topostext.org/place/384233RBoi' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.35,23.25'>Boeotia</a> he made the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/383233PThe' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.3191,23.3178'>Thebans</a> a match for the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Lacedemonians</a>. And another asking why he exercised the virgins' bodies with racing, wrestling, throwing the bar, and the like, he answered: That the first rooting of the children being strong and firm, their growth might be proportionable; and that the women might have strength to bear and more easily undergo the pains of travail, or, if necessity should require, be able to fight for themselves, their country, and their children. Some being displeased that the virgins went about naked at certain solemnities, and demanding the reason of that custom, he replied: That using the same exercises with men, they might equal them in strength and health of body and in courage and bravery of mind, and be above that mean opinion which the vulgar had of them. And hence goes the story of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2412" target="_blank">Gorgo</a>, wife of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=212" target="_blank">Leonidas</a>, that when a stranger, a friend of hers, said, You <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Spartan</a> women alone rule men, she replied, Good reason, for we alone bear men. By ordering that no bachelor should be admitted a spectator of these naked solemnities and fixing some other disgrace on them, he made them all eager to be married and get children; besides, he deprived them of that honor and observance which the young men were bound to pay their elders. And upon that account none can blame what was said to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1045" target="_blank">Dercyllidas</a>, though a brave captain; for as he approached, one of the young men refused to rise up and give him place, saying, You have not begotten any to give place to me. When one asked him why he allowed no dowry to be given with a maid, he answered, that none might be slighted for their poverty or courted for their wealth, but that every one, considering the manners of the maid, might choose for the sake of virtue. And for the same reason he forbade all painting of the face and curiousness in dress and ornament. To one that asked him why he made a law that before such an age neither sex should marry, he answered, that the children might be lusty, being born of persons of full age. And to one wondering why he would not suffer the husband to lie all night with his wife, but commanded them to be most of the day and all the night with their fellows, and creep to their wives cautiously and by stealth, he said: I do it that they may be strong in body, having never been satiated and surfeited with pleasure; that they may be always fresh in love, and their children more strong and lusty. He forbade all perfumes, as nothing but good oil corrupted, and the dyer's art, as a flatterer and enticer of the sense; and he ejected all skilled in ornament and dressing, as those who by their lewd devices corrupt the true arts of decency and living well. At that time the women were so chaste and such strangers to that lightness to which they were afterwards addicted, that adultery was incredible; and there goes a saying of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=9434" target="_blank">Geradatas</a>, one of the ancient <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Spartans</a>, who being asked by a stranger what punishment the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Spartans</a> appointed for adulterers (for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=78" target="_blank">Lycurgus</a> mentioned none), he said, Sir, we have no adulterers amongst us. And he replying, But suppose there should be? <a href="/people_index.php?pid=9434" target="_blank">Geradatas</a> made the same reply; For how (said he) could there be an adulterer in <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a>, where wealth, delicacy, and all ornaments are disesteemed, and modesty, neatness, and obedience to the governors only are in request? When one desired him to establish a democracy in <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Sparta</a>, he said, Pray, sir, do you first set up that form in your own family. And to another demanding why he ordered such mean sacrifices he answered, That we may always be able to honor the Gods. He permitted the citizens those exercises only in which the hand is not stretched out; and one demanding his reason, he replied, That none in any labor may be accustomed to be weary.

When one asked him why he charged his soldiers not to meddle with the spoil of their slain enemies, he replied, Lest while they are eager on their prey they neglect their fighting, but also that they may keep their order and their poverty together. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg082.perseus-grc1:53' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>
