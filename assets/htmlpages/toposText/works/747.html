In 1587 Arthur Golding (more famous for his translation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses) produced a version entitled The Excellent and Pleasant Worke of Julius Ca. Solinus, containing the Noble Actions of Human Creatures, &c. While Golding was on occasions misled by Solinus’ Latin, and failed to translate sections which offended his notions of propriety, his version is generally accurate, and, to modern ears, quaint and charming. As W.H. Stahl remarks, there is a certain appropriateness about an Elizabethan rendition of accounts of mirabilia (W.H. Stahl, Roman Science, p. 141). Stahl goes on to predict dire challenges for anyone undertaking a new translation of the Polyhistor, an “inexpertly and drastically reduced compilation”. If the translator adhered faithfully to the text, he theorised, the results would strike readers as strange, and at times nonsensical. Any attempt to gloss over Solinus’ “carelessness and ignorance”, he continued, would create a false impression of the author. But this is something on an exaggeration. Solinus was (in the main) not nearly so unskillful a writer as Stahl would have us believe. The translated text, as it stands, certainly does not require constant glossing to render it intelligible, though the esoteric nature of certain passages, particularly those describing gemstones (see e.g. XXXIII §18-19) ensures sporadic difficulties. The compilatory nature of the Polyhistor undoubtedly compromises ready comprehension at certain junctures, but the minutiae necessary for a deeper understanding are by no means indispensable navigatory aids. Certain passages do present distractingly contrasting styles (compare, e.g., the two prefatory letters, Chapters I-II, and Chapter XXIV) which may be galling to the modern reader, but I have attempted to preserve these contrasts in an effort to represent the relationship between the author and the text or texts he was abstracting.) <br>This text has 1624 tagged references to 574 ancient places. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>[Open Latin text in new tab]</a></i></p></div><br/>

I have had much experience of this, and thus cannot believe I rashly anticipate your kindness. Therefore, I thought to give the weighing of this trifling work especially to you. Either your diligence promises a ready judgment, or your generosity ready indulgence. 2 As far as reason would allow, this book has been designed with a view to brevity; moderately abridged, it has neither a wasteful abundance nor a detrimental beauty of style. If you study it earnestly, you will find it is leavened with knowledge rather than veneered with a gold-leaf of eloquence. 3 For I confess I have very conscientiously studied a number of excellent books, so I might leave the well-known subjects alone, and devote more attention to those which are less well-known. Observations of places occupy the majority of it, and nearly all the material is connected with the same. It seemed good to me to recall, in order, the famous sites on land, and the famous features of the seas, preserving the differences in the world.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>

I have added some things about strange trees and the appearances of remote tribes, and the unusual rites of far-flung peoples. Also I have included not a few things, worthy of mention, which it seemed negligent to omit. 5 I would wish you, in your industriousness, to particularly understand that the authority for these things stems from the most accepted writers. For what can we claim as our own, since nothing has been passed over by the diligence of old? What remains untouched up to our own era? Therefore, I beg you not to weigh the credit of this work in the present time, seeing indeed that I, having followed the traces of the old stamps, prefer to choose the universal opinions rather than to innovate. 6 Thus, if you have a different opinion on something in my work, I wish you would grant indulgence to my foolishness; the consistency of truth is in the power of those whom I have followed.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>

Now, things which were omitted have been added, with greater care, to the incorrect versions (which have been condemned, although, as if approved, they are widely circulated), towards the development of the inquiry. Lest by chance a rough copy, with incomplete content, as though endorsed by me, fall into your hands, I have sent, as you see, this collection, interspersed with my own opinions. I did so because, in the first place, the layout of the work had to be referred to your diligence, and so the betrayal of rough unshapeliness be expunged from the proper edition. Therefore, the title of the work shall be Polyhistor. The title I had designated in the beginning, to wit, Collection of Marvellous Things, I have rejected, and I am pleased to assign it to oblivion.

This was where <a href="/people_index.php?pid=167" target="_blank">Romulus</a> stayed overnight; he auspiciously laid down the foundations of the walls when he was eighteen years old, eleven days before the Kalends of May, between the second and third hours, as Lucius Tarruntius, a very notable mathematician, has recorded. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1" target="_blank">Jupiter</a> was in Pisces, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=43" target="_blank">Saturn</a>, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=15" target="_blank">Venus</a>, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=24" target="_blank">Mars</a> and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=33" target="_blank">Mercury</a> in Scorpio, the sun in <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10933" target="_blank">Taurus</a> and the moon in Libra. 19 Thereafter it became custom that no victims were sacrificed on this day, the festival of the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=3225" target="_blank">Parilia</a>, so it should be free from blood.

The Senate and the people held elections, and the mistresses served dinner to their slaves, just as masters did at the Saturnalia. The mistresses did this so they might encourage better service by the reward; the masters, as it were, did it so they might reward the slaves for completed work. It can be neatly proved that March was the first month: the fifth month from it was called <a href="/people_index.php?pid=4286" target="_blank">Quintilis</a>, and when the full number was passed through, 36 December completed the annual circuit within 304 days. For at that time that number of days finished the year, as six months had 30 days and the remaining four had 31. 37 But since this system (which was pre-<a href="/people_index.php?pid=523" target="_blank">Numa</a>) differed from the course of the moon, they made the year equal to the lunar reckoning by adding 51 days. 38 So they might make up two more months, bringing the total number of months to 12, they took one day from the first six months, and added them to the extra 51 days. The resulting 57 days were divided into two months, one of which was 29 days long, and the other 28.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>

First of all the bones is the backbone. Because of this, it endangers life if either of these parts are harmed. 63 Certainly, if the little body is being fashioned into a male child, the colour of the mother is better, and the birth is easier.

There are two leaders who rule the onrush: one goes in front of the column and the other brings up the rear — the former that he might lead a direct route and the latter that he might urge on the tardy. This is the discipline of their traveling. 47 When the time for fructifying comes upon them, they dig trenches with their bills, and stretch shoots over the top, imitating the framework of a basket. Thus they cover up the space hollowed out underneath. Lest these lids be found wanting, and the wooden hollows carried away by chance winds, the birds press down the pile with the earth they dug out when raising their wells. 48 They build their nests with double entrances. It is not done fortuitously -- they mark out the entrances and exits according to the regions of the heavens. The opening that dismisses them to the feeding grounds is open to the east, and that which receives them is situated towards the west; thus, light rouses them, and does not deny them for their retreat. For the relieving of their bellies, they fly upwards in adverse winds, so their bodily discharges may be blown further away from them. 49 They judge between visitors. Those who are Greek they permit to approach, and as far as it is to be understood, they fawn coaxingly upon them as countrymen. If they are of another race, they rush upon them and attack. They frequent the sacred shrine every day, and their zeal takes this form: they wet their feathers with water, and they flock together with thoroughly soaked and dewy wings. By shaking off the moisture, they purify the shrine. Then they clap their wings and depart, as though they have completed their worship. 50 Because of this, the birds are said to have been <a href="/people_index.php?pid=124" target="_blank">Diomedes</a>’ companions.

What is common to all partridges, we will now pursue. Partridges make nests with clever defences. They clothe the exits of the nests with thorny bushes, so the animals which harass them are warded off by the harsh prongs. 30 They cover the eggs with dust, and return to them secretly, lest their frequent comings and goings betray where they are. The females repeatedly move the eggs about to cheat the males, who often crush them with their impatient flattering. The males fight for mates, and it is believed that the losers have to let the victors treat them like females. The females are so agitated by sexual lust, that if a breeze blows from the males, they are made pregnant by the smell. 31 If a man draws near where they nest, the mothers come out voluntarily and offer themselves to whoever is approaching. They assume a weakness of foot or wing (seeming as though they might by and by be caught) and counterfeit a limping walk. This fraud incites their enemies, and baffles them, until, enticed for a long while, they are diverted from the nests. 32 Nor are the chicks more torpid in the art of defensive action. When they begin to perceive that they themselves are seen, they cast themselves on their backs, and lift little clods of earth with their feet. They are so cleverly concealed by these that they escape notice even when seized.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>

This is the result of their system of beliefs. 2 Every one of them agrees to a voluntary death, while not a few of them think that their souls return. Others think that their souls are not destroyed by death but become more blessed. Most of them deem childbirths to be sorrowful. Indeed, those who are newly parents receive the birth with weeping. 3 On the contrary, funerals are happy occasions, to such a degree that the deceased are escorted to the pyre with gladness. The men boast about the number of wives they have, and judge many marriages to be an honour. The women hold fast to their modesty. They throw themselves on the funeral pyres of their dead husbands, and, which is held to be the greatest mark of chastity, walk headlong into the flames. 4 Women of marriageable age do not have their husbands chosen by their parents. Those who are most beautiful prefer to be auctioned off, and with the liberty of appraisal permitted them, they do not marry the man of the highest morals, but the man with the most gifts. Those women who are hindered in this by a repulsive appearance obtain dowries, which they use to get a husband.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>

It will not grieve me to recall how they direct their journeys. They go forward like a military company under a standard. Lest the strength of the breeze blow them off course, they consume sand, and ballast themselves with small stones to a moderate weight. 13 Then they hasten aloft, so they can mark the lands they are making for, as if from a tall watchtower. A bird confident of the course goes in front of the flock. She castigates idleness of flight with her voice, which gathers the troop together. When she has grown hoarse, another takes her place. 14 Preparing to cross <a about='https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://43.5,33.5'>Pontus</a>, they aim for the narrowest passage.

When they know themselves to have passed the middle of the channel, their feet drop the bundles of small stones. 15 Sailors report that from this circumstance they are often rained upon with stony showers. The cranes do not bring up the sand again before they are settled as securely as possible. The birds are of one mind in caring for those who become weary; indeed, if some falter, they all flock together and continuously bear up the exhausted ones until they recover their strength by resting. They are not less zealous on land. 16 They divide the night watches so that at any one time ten of them are wakeful. The watchers clasp little weights in their claws, which if by chance are let fall, convict them of slackness. When they perceive something to take precautions against, they make a clamour. Their colour reveals their age: they grow dark with old age.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>

These birds are thought to be appointed to the guardianship of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=127" target="_blank">Latona</a>. They are not seen in all seasons: they arrive when summer is drawing to a close. When they cross the sea, they put off making an effort through fear of a longer journey; they nourish their strength through slowness of movement. 21 When they can clearly see the land, they gather in large flocks and move more vigourously. Their haste often brings destruction upon sailors. At night, the birds rend ships’ sails, and weigh down the folds of sailcloth, so the ships become unbalanced. Quails never fly on the south wind, for they fear the strength of this swollen breeze. They commonly commit themselves to the northern breezes, as they are stronger and drier. Thus they are better able to carry the quails’ bodies, which are somewhat fat, and, because of this, slow. 22 The bird who leads the flock is called “ortygometra”. When he approaches the land, he is seized by a watching hawk; as a result, the work becomes universal. Having stirred up a leader of another kind, the quails escape the first danger. 23 Their favourite food is the seeds of poisonous plants. For this reason, the tables of wise men spurn them. This is the only animal except man to suffer from the falling sickness.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>

Secondly, they restore the tired gaze by the mildness of their colour; smaragdi revive eyes which the brightness of another gemstone has weakened. They do have a disadvantage: although they are difficult indeed to wound, you cannot carve them, lest their beauty be damaged by the pits of the images. 25 The worth of smaragdi is assessed in the following ways: if they are transparent; if, when they are spherical, they colour the things nearest them by the rebounding air; if, when they are concave, they reflect the faces of those looking at them; if they are not altered by shadows either in the light of oil-lamps or in the sunlight.

There are many deer in this land. We shall, therefore, pursue the subject of deer. When the male of this species is incited during mating time, he rages with a fury of desire. 10 Although they may mate with the females before, the females do not conceive prior to the appearance of the star <a href="/people_index.php?pid=632" target="_blank">Arcturus</a>. They do not educate their offspring at adventure. The mothers carefully stow their young, and when they are hidden in the depths of the thickets or foliage, they beat them with their feet so they lie concealed. 11 When their strength has matured enough for speed, the mothers teach by training and running, and accustom their offspring to leap by traversing rough and dangerous paths. When deer hear <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10953" target="_blank">dogs</a> barking, they choose ways down wind, so their scent retreats with them. Deer marvel at the whistling of shepherd’s pipes. They hear most acutely when their ears are standing straight; when their ears are stooping, they hear nothing.

In addition, the fumes of the burning uncover defects, and reveal whether anyone has the falling sickness. The branches of the antlers grow with age. This growth continues for six years; thereupon the branches do not grow more numerous, but they can become thicker. 14 After deer are castrated their antlers never grow; nor, however, do they fall off. 15 The teeth of deer show their age; in old age either few or none are found.

The rennet of a fawn killed in the uterus of its mother is a marvellous remedy for poisons. It is well known that deer are never febrile.

Elephants have an understanding close to the intelligence of humans. They have memories and keep the discipline of the stars. When the moon begins to shine they seek the rivers in herds.

            <p id='urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0264.stoa001:25.3'><b>&sect; 25.3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two breeds of elephant. The more noble breed is indicated by its larger size. They call the smaller breed “bastards”. An elephant is understood to be young if its teeth are white. Of these teeth, one is always in use. The other is spared, lest, blunted by continual abrasion, it is less effective for fighting. 4 When elephants are pursued by hunters, they break both teeth together, so, having damaged the ivory, they are not sought after. For they understand that this is the cause of their danger. They wander in herds. The eldest by birth leads the herd; the nearest in age collects the followers. 5 When they are about to cross a river, they put the smallest in front, lest the elders wear away the river bed by their ingress, and make deep ruts in the low fords. The females do not mate before they are ten years old, and the males before they are five. In a period of two years, elephants do not mate on more than five days in a year. They do not return to the main herd until they have cleansed themselves with fresh water. 6 Because elephants never fight over females, they know no adultery. The virtue of compassion is in them. If they by chance see a man wandering through the desert, they lead him all the way to known paths. Or if they meet with thronging <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10978" target="_blank">cattle</a>, they make passage for themselves with their trunks gently and placidly, lest they kill any animal in the way by an accidental collision.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>

Because of the haste and immaturity, the cubs, excepting the outlines of claws, are nothing but undeveloped bloody matter. The mothers gradually shape the cubs by licking and cherishing them. Sometimes they hold them clasped to the breast, so they might be warmed by continual incubation and draw in the breath of life. 6 Meanwhile, the mothers take no food. Indeed, for the first fourteen days they fall into sleep, and cannot be woken even if wounded. When they have given birth, they lie hidden for four months.

But those which are produced by leopards lack manes and remain undistinguished. All equally refrain from gorging. They do so because they drink and catch food on alternate days; oftentimes, if they do not enjoy good digestion, they postpone their usual repast another day. 14 If the consumed flesh is greater than what is right, and they are weighed down, they put their claws into their mouths and voluntarily bring it to light. 15 They also do the same when fleeing in a state of satiety. Weakness of the teeth indicates old age. The indications of mildness are many: they spare those who prostrate themselves, and they rage against men rather than women.

Also this is able to be said: that the herb of the same name, mixed and consecrated with the right prayers, takes he by whom it is swallowed away from the sight of men.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>

This is affirmed by the Punic Books; we have heard that King <a href="/people_index.php?pid=358" target="_blank">Juba</a> recorded it.

The more strongly, they say, the contrary winds resist, the higher is the swift river beaten back and elevated into vertices of height.

The chameleon is a four-footed creature which looks like a lizard, except it has longer, straight legs which are joined to its belly. It has a long twisty tail, and hooked claws with a subtle inward curvature. It moves slowly, having almost the same gait as a tortoise. The skin of its body is rough, as I have indicated is the case with crocodiles. 22 Its eyes are withdrawn into sunken recesses, and it never obscures them by blinking. It sees not by moving its pupils around, but by directing the gaze of its rigid orbs. It gapes eternally, and without any reason, since it neither captures food nor is sustained by drink. It lives by no other nourishment than by draughts of the air. 23 Its colour is variable, and changes in a moment. It becomes the same colour as whatever it joins itself to. There are two colours which it is not powerful enough to create: white and red. The rest it can easily imitate. Its body is almost without flesh, and the vitals without a spleen. It has little blood, except in its heart. It lies hidden during winter, and comes forth in the spring. 24 It is poisonous to ravens. If it is killed by a raven, it destroys the very conqueror which has killed it, for if the bird consumes even a little of it, it immediately perishes. But the raven has a defence, as Nature has stretched forth its hand with a cure. When the raven understands itself to be afflicted, it eats a laurel leaf, and is restored to health.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>

Now we shall return to the appearance and colours of diamonds. An excellent sort is to be found in a certain type of crystal. Its unclouded radiance is similar to that of the substance in which it is formed. It is smoothed into a hexagonal point on both sides, so as to be cone-shaped, and it is never found above the bigness of a hazelnut kernel. 55{58} Closest to this in distinction is the type found in gold. It is paler, and shines rather with the colour of silver. The third kind occurs in veins of copper, and is nearer to the appearance of brass. The fourth is gathered from iron. It excels the others in weight, but not in strength. 56{59} For both this kind and the kind found in copper can be broken, and for the most part can also be pierced by other diamonds. But the kind which we first mentioned are not conquered by iron, nor subdued by fire. Nevertheless, if they are soaked for a long time in <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10956" target="_blank">goat</a>’s blood, after several hammers and anvils are broken and wasted, they finally yield and split into shards. These fragments are in demand among engravers, who use them for inscribing gems. 57{60} Between the diamond and the lode-stone there is a certain hidden dissension. If the diamond is placed near, it does not allow the lode-stone to snatch iron. Or if the lode-stone has already drawn iron to itself, the diamond snatches it away and steals it, as though it were booty.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>

If it is pure, it lets in an uninterrupted clearness throughout itself, and if it flares up in the rays of the sun and becomes enraged, or made hot by rubbing with the fingers, it snatches chaff husks and filaments of papyrus to itself. 60{63} It stubbornly resists engraving, and if at any time it is carved, when the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10989" target="_blank">seal</a> presses down, it restrains a part of the wax as though a creature with a bite.</p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -1</i> <a href='http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/solinus5.html' target='_blank'>LA</a> </p>        </div>
