While he was still a boy, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1019" target="_blank">Duris</a> says further, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=30" target="_blank">Philip</a>, who was sojourning in the place and had an hour of leisure, came to see the young men and boys of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/405268UKar' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.5482,26.7508'>Cardia</a> exercising in the pancratium and in wrestling, among whom <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> had such success and gave such proofs of intelligence and bravery that he pleased <a href="/people_index.php?pid=30" target="_blank">Philip</a> and was taken into his following. 2 But in my opinion those historians tell a more probable story who say that a tie of guest-friendship with his father led <a href="/people_index.php?pid=30" target="_blank">Philip</a> to give advancement to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>. After <a href="/people_index.php?pid=30" target="_blank">Philip</a>'s death <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> was thought to be inferior to none of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>'s followers in sagacity and fidelity, and though he had only the title of chief secretary, he was held in as much honour as the king's principal friends and intimates, so that on the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://30,74'>Indian</a> expedition he was actually sent out as general with a force under his own orders, and received the command in the cavalry which <a href="/people_index.php?pid=294" target="_blank">Perdiccas</a> had held, when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=294" target="_blank">Perdiccas</a>, after <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a>'s death, was advanced to that officer's position. 3 Therefore when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=385" target="_blank">Neoptolemus</a>, the commander of the Shield-bearers, after <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>'s death, said that he had followed the king with shield and spear, but <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> with pen and paper, the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> laughed him to scorn; they knew that, besides his other honours, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> had been deemed worthy by the king of relationship in marriage. For <a href="/people_index.php?pid=3144" target="_blank">Barsine</a> the daughter of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=667" target="_blank">Artabazus</a>, the first woman whom <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> knew in Asia, and by whom he had a son, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=4" target="_blank">Heracles</a>, had two sisters; of these <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> gave one, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=3530" target="_blank">Apama</a>, to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=21" target="_blank">Ptolemy</a>, and the other, also called <a href="/people_index.php?pid=3144" target="_blank">Barsine</a>, to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>. This was at the time when he distributed the other <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persian</a> women as consorts among his companions. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041.perseus-grc1:1' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041:2'><b>&sect; 2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> was often in collision with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, and he got himself into danger through <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a>. In the first place, for instance, when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a> assigned to Euius the flute-player the quarters which his servants had already taken up for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, accompanied by <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1294" target="_blank">Mentor</a>, came in a passion to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> and cried out that it was best for him to throw away his arms and be a flute-player or a tragic actor. The immediate result was that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> shared his indignation and heaped abuse upon <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a>. Soon, however, he changed his mind and was angry with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, feeling that he had indulged in insolence towards himself more than in bold words against <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a>. 2 Again, when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> was sending out <a href="/people_index.php?pid=601" target="_blank">Nearchus</a> with a fleet to explore the outer sea, he asked money of his friends, since the royal treasury was empty. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> was asked for three hundred talents, but gave only a hundred, and said that even these had been slowly and with difficulty collected for him by his stewards. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> made no reproaches, nor did he take the money, but ordered his servants secretly to set fire to the tent of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, wishing to take its owner in a manifest lie when the treasure was carried out of it. 3 But before that could be done the tent was consumed, and the destruction of his papers made <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> repent him of his orders. Still, the gold and silver that was melted down by the fire was found to be more than a thousand talents' worth. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> took none of it, however, but actually wrote to his satraps and generals everywhere to send copies of the documents that had been destroyed, and ordered <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> to take them all in charge. 4 And still again, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> had a quarrel with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a> about a certain gift, and much abusive language passed between them. At the time, indeed, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> was no less in favour than before; but a little while afterwards <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a> died, and the king, in his bitter sorrow, dealt harshly and was severe with all who, as he thought, had been jealous of his favourite while he lived and now rejoiced at his death. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, in particular, he suspected of such feelings, and often reproached him for his former quarrels with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a> and his abusive language towards him. 5 But <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, who was wily and persuasive, tried to make what threatened his ruin conduce to his salvation. He sought refuge, namely, in <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>'s ardent gratitude towards <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a>, suggesting honours which were most likely to adorn the memory of the deceased, and contributing money for the construction of his tomb lavishly and readily. When <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> was dead and a quarrel had arisen between the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonian</a> men-at war and his principal officers, or companions, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> sided with the latter in his opinions, but in what he said he was a kind of common friend to both and held himself aloof from the quarrel, on the ground that it was no business of his, since he was a stranger, to meddle in disputes of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a>. Moreover, when the rest of the principal officers had withdrawn from <a about='https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://32.542,44.421'>Babylon</a>, he remained behind in the city and mollified many of the men-at war and made them more disposed towards a settlement of the quarrel. 2 And when the officers, having conferred with one another, brought their first tumultuous proceedings to an end, and were distributing satrapies and commands, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> received <a about='https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.8,35'>Cappadocia</a>, <a about='https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://41,30'>Paphlagonia</a>, and the southern coast of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/435335WPon' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://43.5,33.5'>Euxine</a> sea as far as <a about='https://topostext.org/place/375221PTra' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.4563,22.0607'>Trapezus</a>. It is true that at the time this territory was not subject to the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a>, for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=550" target="_blank">Ariarathes</a> held royal sway over it; but <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1114" target="_blank">Leonnatus</a> and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a>, with a great army, were to conduct <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> thither and declare him satrap of the country. 3 Now, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> paid no heed to the edicts of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=294" target="_blank">Perdiccas</a>, being already lifted up in his ambitions and scorning all his associates; but <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1114" target="_blank">Leonnatus</a> came down from the interior into <a about='https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40,31'>Phrygia</a> in order to undertake the expedition in behalf of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>. Here, however, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=745" target="_blank">Hecataeus</a> the tyrant of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/405268UKar' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.5482,26.7508'>Cardia</a> joined him and besought him to go rather to the assistance of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=74" target="_blank">Antipater</a> and the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> besieged in <a about='https://topostext.org/place/389224PLam' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.903,22.4426'>Lamia</a>. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1114" target="_blank">Leonnatus</a> therefore determined to cross over to Greece, invited <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> to go with him, and tried to reconcile him with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=745" target="_blank">Hecataeus</a>. 4 For they had a hereditary distrust of one another arising from political differences; and frequently <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> had been known to denounce <a href="/people_index.php?pid=745" target="_blank">Hecataeus</a> when a tyrant and to exhort <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> to restore its freedom to <a about='https://topostext.org/place/405268UKar' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.5482,26.7508'>Cardia</a>. Therefore at this time also <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> declined to go on the expedition against the Greeks, saying he was afraid that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=74" target="_blank">Antipater</a>, who had long hated him, would kill him to please <a href="/people_index.php?pid=745" target="_blank">Hecataeus</a>. Then <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1114" target="_blank">Leonnatus</a> took him into his confidence and revealed to him all his purposes. 5 Assistance to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=74" target="_blank">Antipater</a>, namely, was what he alleged as a pretext for his expedition, but he really meant, as soon as he had crossed into Europe, to lay claim to <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonia</a>; and he showed certain letters from <a href="/people_index.php?pid=100" target="_blank">Cleopatra</a> in which she invited him to come to <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225PPel' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.754,22.518'>Pella</a> and promised to marry him. But <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, either because he was afraid of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=74" target="_blank">Antipater</a>, or because he despaired of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1114" target="_blank">Leonnatus</a> as a capricious man full of uncertain and rash impulses, took his own equipment and decamped by night. And he had three hundred horsemen, two hundred armed camp-followers, and in gold what would amount to five thousand talents of money. 6 With this equipment he fled to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=294" target="_blank">Perdiccas</a>, and by telling him of the designs of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1114" target="_blank">Leonnatus</a> at once enjoyed great influence with him and was made a member of his council. Moreover, a little while after he was conducted into <a about='https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.8,35'>Cappadocia</a> with an army which <a href="/people_index.php?pid=294" target="_blank">Perdiccas</a> commanded in person. There <a href="/people_index.php?pid=550" target="_blank">Ariarathes</a> was taken prisoner, the country was brought into subjection, and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> was proclaimed satrap. 7 He entrusted the cities of the country to his own friends, appointed commanders of garrisons, left behind him such judges and administrators as he wished, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=294" target="_blank">Perdiccas</a> not at all interfering in these matters, and then marched away with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=294" target="_blank">Perdiccas</a>, desiring to pay court to that general, and not wishing to be separated from the kings. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041.perseus-grc1:2' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

But they had already sent an embassy to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> inviting him to come over to their side; he would enjoy possession of his present satrapies, would receive additional troops and territory from them, would become a friend to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=74" target="_blank">Antipater</a> instead of an enemy, and would not become an enemy to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a> instead of a friend. 5 On hearing this proposition <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> replied that he had been <a href="/people_index.php?pid=74" target="_blank">Antipater</a>'s enemy from of old and could not now become his friend, when he saw him treating his friends as enemies, but that he was ready to reconcile <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a> with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=294" target="_blank">Perdiccas</a> and bring the two together on just and equal terms; if, however, either undertook to overreach the other he would give aid to the injured party as long as he had breath, and would rather lose his life than his honour. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041.perseus-grc1:5' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

They remembered that he had many times incurred the strong displeasure of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> himself in their behalf, by opposing his gradually increasing desire to adopt <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persian</a> customs, and by defending the manners of their country, which, thanks to the spread of luxury and pomp, were already being treated with contempt. 3 At the time of which I speak, then, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a> sent <a href="/people_index.php?pid=74" target="_blank">Antipater</a> into <a about='https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.01,34.01'>Cilicia</a>, while he himself with a large part of the forces advanced with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=385" target="_blank">Neoptolemus</a> against <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>. He thought that he should fall upon him when he was off his guard, and when, after their recent victory, his soldiers were in revelry and disorder. Now, that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> should learn beforehand of his approach and get himself ready for it in advance, one might consider a mark of sober generalship, though not of superlative ability; 4 but that he should keep his enemies from getting any knowledge that would work him harm, and, besides this, that he should hurl his soldiers upon <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a> before they knew with whom they were fighting, and conceal from them the name of the opposing general, seems to me to have been an exploit peculiar to this commander. He gave out word, then, that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=385" target="_blank">Neoptolemus</a> was once more coming against him, with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1960" target="_blank">Pigres</a>, and that they had a force of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/410300RPap' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://41,30'>Paphlagonian</a> and <a about='https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.8,35'>Cappadocian</a> cavalry. One night he was planning to decamp and then fell asleep and had a strange vision. 5 He dreamed, namely, that he saw two Alexanders ready to give each other battle, each at the head of a phalanx; then <a href="/people_index.php?pid=11" target="_blank">Athena</a> came to help the one, and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=48" target="_blank">Demeter</a> the other, and after a fierce struggle the one who had <a href="/people_index.php?pid=11" target="_blank">Athena</a> for a helper was beaten, and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=48" target="_blank">Demeter</a>, culling ears of grain, wove them into a wreath for the victor. 6 At once, then, he conjectured that the vision was in his favour, since he was fighting for a country that was most fertile and had at that time an abundance of fine young grain in the ear; for the land had everywhere been sown and bespoke a time of peace, now that its plains were covered with a luxuriant growth; and he was all the more strengthened in his belief when he learned that the enemy's watchword was '<a href="/people_index.php?pid=11" target="_blank">Athena</a> and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>.' Accordingly, he too gave out a watchword, namely, '<a href="/people_index.php?pid=48" target="_blank">Demeter</a> and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>,' and ordered all his men to crown themselves and wreathe their arms with ears of grain. 7 But though he often felt an impulse to speak out and tell his principal officers who it was against whom their struggle was to be, and not to keep hidden away in his own breast alone a secret so important, nevertheless he abode by his first resolution and made his judgment surety for the peril. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041.perseus-grc1:6' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

For he had strong fears that his <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a>, if they recognized <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a>, would go over to him. 2 He himself, with a division of his best horsemen, three hundred in number, rode along to the right wing, where he purposed to attack <a href="/people_index.php?pid=385" target="_blank">Neoptolemus</a>. When the forces of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> had crossed the intervening hill and were seen coming on to the attack with a swift and impetuous dash, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a> was dumbfounded and heaped much abuse upon <a href="/people_index.php?pid=385" target="_blank">Neoptolemus</a> for having deceived him about the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> changing sides; but he exhorted his officers to act like brave men, and he charged upon the enemy. 3 The first collision was severe, the spears were quickly shattered, and the fighting was done with the swords. Here <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a> did not disgrace <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, but slew many foes, and frequently routed the opposing arrays. At last, however, he was wounded by a Thracian who attacked him from the side, and fell from his <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horse</a>. 4 As he lay prostrate there all his enemies rode past him, not knowing who he was, except <a href="/people_index.php?pid=367" target="_blank">Gorgias</a>, one of the officers of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>; he recognized him, dismounted from his <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horse</a>, and stood guard over his body, for he was now in an evil plight and struggling with death. In the meantime <a href="/people_index.php?pid=385" target="_blank">Neoptolemus</a> also was engaged with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>. They had long hated one another with a deadly hatred, but in two onsets neither had caught sight of the other; in the third, however, they recognized each other, and at once drew their swords and with loud cries rode to the attack. 5 Their <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a> dashed together with the violence of colliding triremes, and dropping the reins they clutched one another with their hands, each trying to tear off the other's helmet and strip the breastplate from his shoulders. While they were struggling, their <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a> ran from under them and they fell to the ground, where they closed with one another and wrestled for the mastery. 6 Then <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, as <a href="/people_index.php?pid=385" target="_blank">Neoptolemus</a> sought to rise first, gave him an undercut in the ham, and himself got to his feet before his adversary did; but <a href="/people_index.php?pid=385" target="_blank">Neoptolemus</a>, supporting himself on one knee, and wounded in the other, defended himself vigorously from underneath. He could not, however, inflict fatal wounds, but was himself wounded in the neck, fell to the ground, and lay there prostrate. 7 His sword, however, he still retained, and while <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, transported with rage and ancient hatred, was stripping off his armour and reviling him, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=385" target="_blank">Neoptolemus</a> surprised him with a wound under the breastplate, where it reaches the groin. But the blow gave <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> more fright than harm, since lack of strength made it feeble. After stripping the dead body, weak as he was from wounds received in legs and arms, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> nevertheless had himself put upon his <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horse</a> and hastened to the other wing, supposing that the enemy were still resisting. 8 But when he learned of the fate of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a> and had ridden up to where he lay, and saw that he was still alive and conscious, he dismounted, wept bitterly, clasped his hand, and had many words of abuse for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=385" target="_blank">Neoptolemus</a>, and many words of pity for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a> in his evil fortune, and for himself in the necessity which had brought him into a conflict with a friend and comrade, where he must do or suffer this harm. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041.perseus-grc1:7' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

It lifted his reputation high, and he was thought to have accomplished his task alike with wisdom and bravery; but it got him much envy and hatred as well among his allies as among his enemies. They felt that he, an alien and a stranger, had used the arms and might of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> for slaying the foremost and most approved of them. 2 Now, if <a href="/people_index.php?pid=294" target="_blank">Perdiccas</a> could have learned in time of the death of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a>, no one else would have had chief place among <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a>; but as it was, he was slain in a mutiny of his soldiers in <a about='https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://27.1,30.7'>Egypt</a> two days before the report of the battle came to his camp, and his <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a>, in a rage, at once condemned <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> to death. Moreover, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> was appointed to conduct the war against him, in conjunction with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=74" target="_blank">Antipater</a>. 3 When <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> fell in with the royal herds of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horse</a> that were pasturing about Mount <a about='https://topostext.org/place/397268LIda' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://39.6922,26.8423'>Ida</a>, he took as many <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a> as he wanted and sent a written statement of the number to the overseers, at this, we are told, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=74" target="_blank">Antipater</a> laughed and said that he admired <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> for his forethought, since he evidently expected to give an account of the royal properties to them, or to receive one from them. 4 Because he was superior in cavalry, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> wished to give battle in the plains of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/385280RLyd' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.5,28'>Lydia</a> about <a about='https://topostext.org/place/385280PSar' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.4883,28.0403'>Sardis</a>, and at the same time he was ambitious to make a display of his forces before <a href="/people_index.php?pid=100" target="_blank">Cleopatra</a>; but at the request of that princess, who was afraid to give <a href="/people_index.php?pid=74" target="_blank">Antipater</a> any cause for complaint, he marched away into upper <a about='https://topostext.org/place/400310RPhr' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40,31'>Phrygia</a> and wintered at <a about='https://topostext.org/place/381302PApa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.073,30.174'>Celaenae</a>.

' 5 Moreover, having promised to give his soldiers their pay within three days, he sold them the homesteads and castles about the country, which were full of slaves and flocks. Then every captain in the phalanx or commander of mercenaries who had bought a place was supplied by <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> with implements and engines of war and took it by siege; and thus every soldier received the pay that was due him, in a distribution of the captured properties. 6 In consequence of this, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> was again in high favour; and once when letters were found in his camp which the leaders of the enemy had caused to be scattered there, wherein they offered a hundred talents and honours to any one who should kill <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, his <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> were highly incensed and made a decree that a thousand of the leading soldiers should serve him continually as a body-guard, watching over him when he went abroad and spending the night at his door. 7 These carried out the decree, and were delighted to receive from <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> such honours as kings bestow upon their friends. For he was empowered to distribute purple caps and military cloaks, and this was a special gift of royalty among <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a>. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041.perseus-grc1:8' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

For, to begin with, he was defeated by <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> at Orcynii in <a about='https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.8,35'>Cappadocia</a> through treachery, and yet, though in flight, he did not suffer the traitor to make his escape out of the rout to the enemy, but seized and hanged him. Then, taking the opposite route in his flight to that of his pursuers, he changed his course before they knew it, and, passing along by them, came to the place where the battle had been fought. Here he encamped, collected the bodies of the dead, and burned them on pyres made from the doors of the neighbouring villages, which he had split into billets. He burned the bodies of the officers on one pyre, those of the common soldiers on another, heaped great mounds of earth over the ashes, and departed, so that even <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a>, when he came up later, admired his boldness and constancy. 3 Again, when he came upon the baggage of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a>, and could easily have captured many freemen, many slaves, and wealth amassed from so many wars and plunderings, he was afraid that his men, if loaded down with booty and spoils, would become too heavy for flight, and too luxurious to endure wanderings and lapse of time. In lapse of time, however, he placed his chief hopes for ending the war, feeling that he could thus cause <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> to turn back. 4 But since it was quite a difficult matter to deflect his <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> from good things which were within their reach, he ordered them to refresh themselves and bait their <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a> before advancing upon the enemy. He himself, however, sent a secret message to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=156" target="_blank">Menander</a>, who was in charge of the enemy's baggage, implying that he was concerned for him as an old time friend and comrade, and advising him to be on his guard and withdraw as quickly as possible from his low-lying and accessible position to the foot-hills near by, which could not be reached by cavalry or surrounded. 5 <a href="/people_index.php?pid=156" target="_blank">Menander</a> speedily comprehended his peril and decamped, and then <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> openly sent out scouts and ordered his soldiers to arm themselves and bridle their <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a>, as he was going to lead them against the enemy. But when the scouts brought word that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=156" target="_blank">Menander</a> was altogether safe from capture now that he had taken refuge in a difficult region, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> pretended to be vexed, and led his forces away. 6 And it is said that when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=156" target="_blank">Menander</a> bore witness of these things to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a>, and the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> began to praise <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> and felt more kindly towards him, because, when it was in his power to enslave their children and outrage their wives, he had spared them and let them go, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> said: 'Nay, my good men, that fellow did not let them go out of regard for you, but because he was afraid to put such fetters on himself in his flight.' </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041.perseus-grc1:9' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

A long conference was held, in which <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> made no mention of his own safety or peace, but actually demanded that he should be confirmed in the possession of his satrapies, and that what was his by gift should be restored to him.

Therefore, wishing to remove the weakness and languor with which their inactivity afflicted them, and, more than that, to have them somehow or other in training for flight, if opportunity should offer, 4 he assigned the men a house, the largest in the place, fourteen cubits long, a as a place to walk, ordering them little by little to increase their pace. And as for the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a>, he had them all girt round the neck with great straps fastened to the roof, and raised them partly up into the air by means of pulleys, so, while with their hind legs they rested firmly upon the ground, they just touched it with the tips of their fore hoofs. 5 Then, while they were thus suspended, the grooms would stand at their sides and stir them up with shouts and strokes of the goad; and the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a>, full of rage and fury, would dance and leap about on their hind legs, while with their swinging fore feet they would strike the ground and try to get a footing there, thus exerting their whole bodies and covering themselves with sweat and foam, — no bad exercise either for speed or strength.

These men, on receiving their letters, ostensibly treated <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> with friendliness, but were plainly full of envy and contentiousness, disdaining to be second to him. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> therefore allayed their envy by not taking the money, alleging that he had no need of it; 3 while upon their love of contention and love of command, seeing that they were as unable to lead as they were unwilling to follow, he brought superstition to bear. He said, namely, that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> had appeared to him in a dream, had shown him a tent arrayed in royal fashion with a throne standing in it, and had then said that if they held their councils and transacted their business there, he himself would be present and would assist them in every plan and enterprise which they undertook in his name. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> easily convinced <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1198" target="_blank">Antigenes</a> and Teutamus that this was true. They were unwilling to go to him, and he himself thought it undignified to be seen at the doors of others. 4 So they erected a royal tent, and a throne in it which they dedicated to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, and there they met for deliberation on matters of highest importance. And now, as they advanced into the interior of the country, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1899" target="_blank">Peucestas</a>, who was a friend of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, met them with the other satraps, and they joined their forces, so that the number of their men and the splendour of their equipment raised the spirits of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a>. But the leaders themselves had been made unmanageable by their exercise of power, and effeminate by their mode of life, after the death of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, 5 and they brought into collision spirits that were tyrannical and fed on barbaric arrogance, so that they were harsh towards one another and hard to reconcile. Moreover, by flattering the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonian</a> soldiery extravagantly and lavishing money upon them for banquets and sacrifices, in a short time they made the camp a hostelry of festal prodigality, and the army a mob to be cajoled into the election of its generals, as in a democracy. 6 <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, however, perceiving that, while they despised one another, they feared him and were on the watch for an opportunity to kill him, pretended to be in need of money, and got together many talents by borrowing from those who hated him most, in order that they might put confidence in him and refrain from killing him out of regard for the money they had lent him. The consequence was that the wealth of others was his body-guard, and that, whereas men generally preserve their lives by giving, he alone won safety by receiving. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -320</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041.perseus-grc1:13' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

But after they had advanced a little way, suddenly the enemy were seen passing over some hills and descending into the plain. 4 The gleams of their golden armour in the sun flashed down from the heights as they marched along in close formation, and on the backs of the elephants the towers and purple trappings were seen, which was their array when going into battle. Accordingly, the foremost <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> halted in their march and called with loud cries for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, declaring that they would not go forward unless he was in command of them; and grounding their arms they passed word to one another to wait, and to their leaders to keep still, and without <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> not to give battle or run any hazard even with the enemy. 5 When <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> heard of this, he quickened the pace of his bearers to a run and came to them, and lifting the curtains of his litter on either side, stretched forth his hand in delight.

He therefore hastened to lead his army to battle.2 But when, as the enemy were forming in battle order, he had ridden past their lines and observed their shape and disposition, he was amazed, and paused for some time; then the litter was seen as it was carried from one wing to the other. At this, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> gave a loud laugh, as was his wont, and after saying to his friends, 'This litter, it would seem, is what is arrayed against us,' immediately retired with his forces and pitched his camp. 3 But the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> opposed to him, after getting a little respite, once more acted like a capricious mob, and, mocking at their leaders, distributed themselves in winter quarters over almost the whole of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6493" target="_blank">Gabene</a>, so that the rear was separated from the van by almost a thousand furlongs. When <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> became aware of this, he set out suddenly against them, taking this time a road that was difficult and without water, but direct and short, hoping that, in case he fell upon them when they were scattered about in their winter quarters, it would no longer be easy for the mass of them to join their generals. But after he had entered an uninhabited country, dire winds and severe frosts gave trouble to his army and impeded their march. 4 The only help, therefore, was to burn many fires, and this was what revealed his presence to the enemy. For the Barbarians living on the mountains which overlooked the uninhabited tract, amazed at the number of fires, sent messengers on dromedaries to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1899" target="_blank">Peucestas</a>. And he, when he heard the news, being himself quite out of his mind with fear and seeing that the other officers were in a like state, set out to fly, after rousing up those of their soldiers especially who were quartered along the route. 5 But <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> tried to put a stop to their confusion and panic fear, by promising so to check the speed of the enemy that they would come up three days later than they were expected. And when his hearers were persuaded, he sent round messengers with orders that the forces in winter quarters and elsewhere should assemble with all speed; at the same time, too, he himself rode for with the other commanders, took possession of a place which could be seen at a distance by such as traversed the desert, measured it off, and ordered many fires to be made at intervals, as in an encampment. 6 This was done, and when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> saw these fires on the mountains, he was distressed and disheartened, supposing that his enemies had long been aware of his approach and were coming to meet him. In order, therefore, that he might not be forced to fight, when his men were worn and weary from their march, against those who had spent a comfortable winter and were ready for the conflict, he forsook the direct road and led his army through villages and cities, taking time to refresh it. 7 But when no one tried to obstruct his progress, the thing which usually happens when enemies are facing one another, and when the people round about said they had seen no army, but that the place was full of lighted fires, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> perceived that he had been outgeneraled by <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, and in deep resentment led his forces forward to try the issue in open battle. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041.perseus-grc1:15' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

At this, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1198" target="_blank">Antigenes</a> and Teutamus, the leaders of the Silver-shields, were filled with vexation and jealousy, so that they plotted against the life of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, and, assembling most of the satraps and generals, deliberated when and how they might put him out of the way. 2 They were unanimous in the decision to make every use of him in the ensuing battle, and after the battle to kill him at once. But <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1780" target="_blank">Eudamus</a>, the master of the elephants, and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1846" target="_blank">Phaedimus</a>, secretly brought word to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> of this decision; not that they were moved by any goodwill or kindness, but because they were anxious not to lose the money they had lent him. These men <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> commended, and then went off to his tent, where he said to his friends that he was living in a great herd of wild beasts. Then he made his will, and tore up and destroyed his papers; he did not wish that after his death, in consequence of the secrets contained in these documents, accusations and calumnies should be brought against his correspondents. 3 After this business had been finished, he deliberated whether to give over the victory to the enemy, or to take flight through <a about='https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://35.5,48'>Media</a> and <a about='https://topostext.org/place/397443RArm' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://39.702,44.298'>Armenia</a> and invade <a about='https://topostext.org/place/388350RCap' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.8,35'>Cappadocia</a>. He came to no decision while his friends were with him, but after considering many expedients with a mind which was as versatile as his fortunes were changeable, he proceeded to draw up his forces, urging on the Greeks and the Barbarians, and himself exhorted by the phalanx and the Silver-shields to be of good courage, since, as they felt sure, the enemy would not withstand their attack. 4 And indeed they were the oldest soldiers of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=30" target="_blank">Philip</a> and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, war's athletes as it were, without a defeat or a fall up to that time, many of them now seventy years old, and not a man younger than sixty. And so, when they charged upon the forces of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a>, they shouted; 'It is against your fathers that ye sin, ye miscreants;' and falling upon them in a rage they crushed their whole phalanx at once, not a man withstanding them, and most of their opponents being cut to pieces at close quarters. 5 At this point, then, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> was defeated overwhelmingly, but with his cavalry he got the upper hand; for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1899" target="_blank">Peucestas</a> fought in a way that was altogether lax and ignoble, and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> captured all the baggage. He was a man who kept cool in the presence of danger, and he was aided by the ground. 6 For the plain where they fought was vast, and its soil was neither deep nor trodden hard, but sandy and full of a dry and saline substance, which, loosened up by the trampling of so many <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a> and men during the battle, issued forth in a dust like lime, and this made the air all white and obscured the vision. Therefore it was easy for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> to capture the enemy's baggage unobserved. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041.perseus-grc1:16' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041:17'><b>&sect; 17</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;After the battle was over, Teutamus at once sent an embassy to treat for the baggage. And when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> promised not only to give this back to the Silver-shields but also to treat them kindly in other ways, the Silver-shields formed a dire design to put the man alive into the hands of his enemies. 2 So, to begin with, they drew near him, without awakening his suspicions, and kept him in ward, some making complaints about their baggage, others bidding him to be of good courage, since he was victorious, and others still denouncing their former commanders. Then they fell upon him, snatched their sword away from him, and tied his hands fast with his girdle. And when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=401" target="_blank">Nicanor</a> had been sent by <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> to receive him and he was being led along through the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a>, he begged for leave to speak to them, not with a view to supplication or entreaty, but in order to set forth what was for their advantage. 3 Silence was made, and standing on an eminence he stretched forth his hands, bound as they were, and said: 'What trophy, O ye basest of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a>, could <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> have so much desired to set up over your defeat, as this which ye yourselves are now erecting by delivering up your general as a prisoner? It is not a dreadful thing, then, that in the hour of your victory ye should acknowledge yourselves defeated for the sake of your baggage, implying that victory lies in your possessions and not in your arms, but ye must also send your leader as a ransom for that baggage. 4 As for me, then, ye lead me away undefeated, a victor over my enemies, a victim of my fellow-soldiers; but as for you, by <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1" target="_blank">Zeus</a> the god of armies and by the gods who hallow oaths, I bid you slay me here with your own hands. Even should I be slain yonder, it will be wholly your work. Nor will <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a> find any fault; for he wants a dead and not a living <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>. And if ye would spare your own hands, one of mine, if released, will suffice to do the business. 5 And if ye cannot trust me with a sword, cast me under the feet of your elephants, all bound as I am. If ye do this, I will absolve you from your guilt towards me, holding that ye have shown yourselves most just and righteous in your dealings with your own general.' </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg041.perseus-grc1:17' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

At the same time they led him along at a quickened pace. 2 But <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a>, fearing their multitude (since no one had been left behind in the camp), sent out ten of his strongest elephants and a great number of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=538" target="_blank">Median</a> and <a about='https://topostext.org/place/370585RPar' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37,58.5'>Parthian</a> spearmen to drive away the throng. He himself could not endure to see <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, by reason of their former intimate friendship, and when those who had received him asked how they should guard his person, he said: 'Just as ye would an elephant or a <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10960" target="_blank">lion</a>.' 3 But after a little while he became compassionate and ordered the keepers to remove the prisoner's heavy fetters and admit one of his personal servants to anoint him, and permitted any one of his friends who wished to spend the day with him and bring what he needed. Then he deliberated many days what to do with him, and considered various arguments and suggestions, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=32" target="_blank">Demetrius</a> his son and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=601" target="_blank">Nearchus</a> the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/352252IKre' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://35.2052,25.1836'>Cretan</a> being eager to save the life of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, while the rest, almost all of them, were insistent in urging that he be put to death. 4 We are told, also, that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a> asked his keeper, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1298" target="_blank">Onomarchus</a>, why in the world <a href="/people_index.php?pid=31" target="_blank">Antigonus</a>, now that he had got a hated enemy in his hands, neither killed him speedily nor generously set him free; and when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1298" target="_blank">Onomarchus</a> insolently told him it was not now, but on the field of battle, that he should have faced death boldly, 'Yea, by <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1" target="_blank">Zeus</a>,' said <a href="/people_index.php?pid=49" target="_blank">Eumenes</a>, 'then, too, I did do; ask the men who fought with me; I know that none I met was a better man.'
