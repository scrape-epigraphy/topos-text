Whereas he was of a fair colour, as they say, and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly, and in his face. 4 Moreover, that a very pleasant odour exhaled from his skin and that there was a fragrance about his mouth and all his flesh, so that his garments were filled with it, this we have read in the Memoirs of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=633" target="_blank">Aristoxenus</a>. 5 Now, the cause of this, perhaps, was the temperament of his body, which was a very warm and fiery one; for fragrance is generated, as <a href="/people_index.php?pid=129" target="_blank">Theophrastus</a> thinks, where moist humours are acted upon by heat. 6 Wherefore the dry and parched regions of the world produce the most and best spices; for the sun draws away the moisture which, like material of corruption, abounds in vegetable bodies. 7 And in <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>'s case, it was the heat of his body, as it would seem, which made him prone to drink, and choleric. 8 But while he was still a boy his self-restraint showed itself in the fact that, although he was impetuous and violent in other matters, the pleasures of the body had little hold upon him, and he indulged in them with great moderation, while his ambition kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years. 9 For it was neither every kind of fame nor fame from every source that he courted, as <a href="/people_index.php?pid=30" target="_blank">Philip</a> did, who plumed himself like a sophist on the power of his oratory, and took care to have the victories of his chariots at <a about='https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.6378,21.63'>Olympia</a> engraved upon his coins; nay, when those about him inquired whether he would be willing to contend in the foot-race at the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/376216SOly' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.6378,21.63'>Olympic</a> games, since he was swift of foot, 'Yes,' said he, 'if I could have kings as my contestants.' And in general, too, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> appears to have been averse to the whole race of athletes; at any rate, though he instituted very many contests, not only for tragic poets and players on the flute and players on the lyre, but also for rhapsodists, as well as for hunting of every sort and for fighting with staves, he took no interest in offering prizes either for boxing or for the pancratium. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:4' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

He won upon them by his friendliness, and by asking no childish or trivial questions, 2 but by enquiring about the length of the roads and the character of the journey into the interior, about the king himself, what sort of a warrior he was, and what the prowess and might of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persians</a>. 3 The envoys were therefore astonished and regarded the much-talked of ability of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=30" target="_blank">Philip</a> as nothing compared with his son's eager disposition to do great things. 4 At all events, as often as tidings were brought that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=30" target="_blank">Philip</a> had either taken a famous city or been victorious in some celebrated battle, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> was not very glad to hear them, but would say to his comrades: 'Boys, my father will anticipate everything; and for me he will leave no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world with your aid.' For since he did not covet pleasure, nor even wealth, but excellence and fame, he considered that the more he should receive from his father the fewer would be the successes won by himself. 6 Therefore, considering that increase in prosperity meant the squandering upon his father of opportunities for achievement, he preferred to receive from him a realm which afforded, not wealth nor luxury and enjoyment, but struggles and wars and ambitions. 7 In the work of caring for him, then, many persons, as was natural, were appointed to be his nurturers, tutors, and teachers, but over them all stood <a href="/people_index.php?pid=212" target="_blank">Leonidas</a>, a man of stern temperament and a kinsman of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=272" target="_blank">Olympias</a>. Although he did not himself shun the title of tutor, since the office afforded an honourable and brilliant occupation, yet by other people, owing to his dignity and his relationship, he was called <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>'s foster-father and preceptor. 8 The man, however, who assumed the character and the title of tutor was <a href="/people_index.php?pid=123" target="_blank">Lysimachus</a>, a native of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/388210RAka' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.8,21'>Acarnania</a>, who had no general refinement, but because he called himself <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1543" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> <a href="/people_index.php?pid=17" target="_blank">Achilles</a>, and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=30" target="_blank">Philip</a> <a href="/people_index.php?pid=109" target="_blank">Peleus</a>, was highly regarded and held a second place. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:5' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

And this is a copy of the letter. '<a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=46" target="_blank">Aristotle</a>, greeting. 7 Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property? But I had rather excel in my acquaintance with the best things than in my power. Farewell.' 8 Accordingly, in defending himself, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=46" target="_blank">Aristotle</a> encourages this ambition of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> by saying that the doctrines of which he spoke were both published and not published; 9 for in truth his treatise on metaphysics is of no use for those who would either teach or learn the science, but is written as a memorandum for those already trained therein. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:7' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

For he was not only fond of the theory of medicine, but actually came to the aid of his friends when they were sick, and prescribed for them certain treatments and regimens, as one can gather from his letters. 2 He was also by nature a lover of learning and a lover of reading. And since he thought and called the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=12111" target="_blank">Iliad</a> a viaticum of the military art, he took with him <a href="/people_index.php?pid=46" target="_blank">Aristotle</a>'s recension of the poem, called the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=12111" target="_blank">Iliad</a> of the Casket, and always kept it lying with his dagger under his pillow, as <a href="/people_index.php?pid=936" target="_blank">Onesicritus</a> informs us; 3 and when he could find no other books in the interior of Asia, he ordered <a href="/people_index.php?pid=477" target="_blank">Harpalus</a> to send him some. So <a href="/people_index.php?pid=477" target="_blank">Harpalus</a> sent him the books of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=910" target="_blank">Philistus</a>, a great many of the tragedies of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=75" target="_blank">Euripides</a>, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=131" target="_blank">Sophocles</a>, and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=174" target="_blank">Aeschylus</a>, and the dithyrambic poems of Telestes and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=489" target="_blank">Philoxenus</a>. 4 <a href="/people_index.php?pid=46" target="_blank">Aristotle</a> he admired at the first, and loved him, as he himself used to say, more than he did his father, for that the one had given him life, but the other had taught him a noble life; later, however, he held him in more or less of suspicion, not to the extent of doing him any harm, but his kindly attentions lacked their former ardour and affection towards him, and this was proof of estrangement. 5 However, that eager yearning for philosophy which was imbedded in his nature and which ever grew with his growth, did not subside from his soul, as is testified by the honour in which he held <a href="/people_index.php?pid=955" target="_blank">Anaxarchus</a>, by his gift of fifty talents to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=365" target="_blank">Xenocrates</a>, and by the attentions which he so lavishly bestowed upon <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2613" target="_blank">Dandamis</a> and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1817" target="_blank">Calanus</a>. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:8' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

Dost thou take me for a bastard?' threw a cup at him. 9 Then <a href="/people_index.php?pid=30" target="_blank">Philip</a> rose up against him with drawn sword, but, fortunately for both, his anger and his wine made him trip and fall. Then <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, mocking over him, said: 'Look now, men! here is one who was preparing to cross from Europe into Asia; and he is upset in trying to cross from couch to couch.' After this drunken broil <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> took <a href="/people_index.php?pid=272" target="_blank">Olympias</a> and established her in <a about='https://topostext.org/place/395205REpe' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://39.5,20.5'>Epirus</a>, while he himself tarried in <a about='https://topostext.org/place/405195RIll' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.8,19.8'>Illyria</a>.

These made a stand at a certain eminence, and asked that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> should promise them quarter. But he, influenced by anger more than by reason, charged foremost upon them and lost his <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horse</a>, which was smitten through the ribs with a sword (it was not <a href="/people_index.php?pid=4904" target="_blank">Bucephalas</a>, but another); and most of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> who were slain or wounded fought or fell there, since they came to close quarters with men who knew how to fight and were desperate.

Then he was in doubt as to his future course. 3 Many times he was eager to encounter <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a> and put the whole issue to hazard, and many times he would make up his mind to practice himself first, as it were, and strengthen himself by acquiring the regions along the sea with their resources, and then to go up against that monarch. 4 Now, there is in <a about='https://topostext.org/place/365295RLyc' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://36.5,29.5'>Lycia</a>, near the city of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/364293PXan' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://36.3565,29.3182'>Xanthus</a>, a spring, which at this time, as we are told, was of its own motion upheaved from its depths, and overflowed, and cast forth a bronze tablet bearing the prints of ancient letters, in which it was made known that the empire of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persians</a> would one day be destroyed by the Greeks and come to an end. 5 Encouraged by this prophecy, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> hastened to clear up the sea-coast as far as <a about='https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.01,34.01'>Cilicia</a> and <a about='https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://33.5,35.4'>Phoenicia</a>. 6 His rapid passage along the coasts of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/370320RPam' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.01,32.01'>Pamphylia</a> has afforded many historians material for bombastic and terrifying description. They imply that by some great and heaven-sent good fortune the sea retired to make way for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, although at other times it always came rolling in with violence from the main, and scarcely ever revealed to sight the small rocks which lie close up under the precipitous and riven sides of the mountain. 7 And <a href="/people_index.php?pid=156" target="_blank">Menander</a>, in one of his comedies, evidently refers jestingly to this marvel: — 'How <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>-like, indeed, this is; and if I seek some one, Spontaneous he'll present himself; and if I clearly must Pass through some place by sea, this will lie open to my steps.' 8 <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> himself, however, made no such prodigy out of it in his letters, but says that he marched by way of the so called Ladder, and passed through it, setting out from <a about='https://topostext.org/place/365306PPha' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://36.524,30.552'>Phaselis</a>. 9 This was the reason for his spending several days in that city, during which he noticed that a statue of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=8399" target="_blank">Theodectas</a>, a deceased citizen of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/365306PPha' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://36.524,30.552'>Phaselis</a>, had been erected in the market-place.

'No, indeed,' said one of his companions, 'but rather in that of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>; for the property of the conquered must belong to the conqueror, and be called his.' And when he saw the basins and pitchers and tubs and caskets, all of gold, and curiously wrought, while the apartment was marvellously fragrant with spices and unguents, and when he passed from this into a tent which was worthy of admiration for its size and height, and for the adornment of the couch and tables and banquet prepared for him, he turned his eyes upon his companions and said: 'This, as it would seem, is to be a king.' </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:20' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

The belief arose from the time which he would spend over each cup, talking than in drinking, always holding some long discourse, and this too when he had abundant leisure. 2 For in the stress of affairs he was not to be detained, as other commanders were, either by wine, or sleep, or any sport, or amour, or spectacle. This is proved by his life, which, though altogether brief, he filled to overflowing with the greatest exploits. 3 In his times of leisure, however, after rising and sacrificing to the gods, he immediately took breakfast sitting; then, he would spend the day in hunting, or administering justice, or arranging his military affairs, or reading. 4 If he were making a march which was not very urgent, he would practise, as he went along, either archery or mounting and dismounting from a chariot that was under way. Often, too, for diversion, he would hunt <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10958" target="_blank">foxes</a> or birds, as may be gathered from his journals. 5 After he had taken quarters for the night, and while he was enjoying bath or anointing, he would enquire of his chief cooks and bakers whether the arrangements for his supper were duly made. 6 When it was late and already dark, he would begin his supper, reclining on a couch, and marvellous was his care and circumspection at table, in order that everything might be served impartially and without stint; but over the wine, as I have said, he would sit long, for conversation's sake. 7 And although in other ways he was of all princes most agreeable in his intercourse, and endowed with every grace, at this time his boastfulness would make him unpleasant and very like a common soldier. Not only was he himself carried away into blustering, but he suffered himself to be ridden by his flatterers. There were a great annoyance to the finer spirits in the company, who desired neither to vie with the flatterers, nor yet to fall behind them in praising <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>. The one course they thought disgraceful, the other had its perils. 8 After the drinking was over, he would take a bath and sleep, frequently until midday; and sometimes he would actually spend the entire day in sleep. 9 In the matter of delicacies, too, he himself, at all events, was master of his appetite, so that often, when the rarest fruits or fish were brought to him from the sea-coast, he would distribute them to each of his companions until he was the only one for whom nothing remained. His suppers, however, were always magnificent, and the outlay upon them increased with his successes until it reached the sum of ten thousand drachmas.

As for <a about='https://topostext.org/place/350330RCyp' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://35,33'>Cyprus</a>, then, its kings came at once and put the island in his hands, together with <a about='https://topostext.org/place/335354RPho' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://33.5,35.4'>Phoenicia</a>, with the exception of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://33.272,35.196'>Tyre</a>. 5 But <a about='https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://33.272,35.196'>Tyre</a> he besieged for seven months, with moles, and engines-of war, and two hundred triremes by sea. During this siege he had a dream in which he saw <a href="/people_index.php?pid=4" target="_blank">Heracles</a> stretching out his hand to him from the wall and calling him. 6 And many of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://33.272,35.196'>Tyrians</a> dreamed that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2" target="_blank">Apollo</a> told them he was going away to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, since he was displeased at what was going on in the city. 7 Whereupon, as if the god had been a common deserter caught in the act of going over to the enemy, they encircled his colossal figure with cords and nailed it down to its pedestal, calling him an Alexandrist. 8 In another dream, too, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> thought he saw a satyr who mocked him at a distance, and eluded his grasp when he tried to catch him, but finally, after much coaxing and chasing, surrendered. 9 The seers, dividing the word 'satyros' into two parts, said to him, plausibly enough, '<a about='https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://33.272,35.196'>Tyre</a> is to be thine.' And a spring is pointed out, near which <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> dreamed he saw the satyr. While the siege of the city was in progress, he made an expedition against the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/280400RAra' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://28,40'>Arabians</a> who dwelt in the neighbourhood of Mount Antilibanus. On this expedition he risked his life to save his tutor, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=123" target="_blank">Lysimachus</a>, who insisted on following him, declaring himself to be neither older nor weaker than <a href="/people_index.php?pid=569" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>. But when the force drew near the mountains, they abandoned their <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a> and proceeded on foot, and most of them got far on in advance. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> himself, however, would not consent to abandon the worn and weary <a href="/people_index.php?pid=123" target="_blank">Lysimachus</a>, since evening was already coming on and the enemy were near, but sought to encourage him and carry him along. Before he was aware of it, therefore, he was separated from the army with a few followers, and had to spend a night of darkness and intense cold in a region that was rough and difficult. In this plight, he saw far off a number of scattered fires which the enemy were burning. So, since he was confident in his own agility, and was ever wont to cheer the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> in their perplexities by sharing their toils, he ran to the nearest camp-fire. Two Barbarians who were sitting at the fire he despatched with his dagger, and snatching up a fire-brand, brought it to his own party. These kindled a great fire and at once frightened some of the enemy into flight, routed others who came up against them, and spent the night without further peril.

While <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> was giving the greater part of his forces a rest from the many struggles which they had undergone, and was leading up only a few men to attack the walls, in order that the enemy might have no respite, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1772" target="_blank">Aristander</a> the seer made a sacrifice, and after taking the omens, declared very confidently to the bystanders that the city would certainly be captured during that month. 2 His words produced laughter and jesting, since it was then the last day of the month, and the king, seeing that he was perplexed, and being always eager to support his prophecies, gave orders to reckon that day, not as the thirtieth of the month, but as the twenty-eighth; and then, after the trumpet had sounded the signal, he attacked the walls with greater vigour than he had at first intended. 3 The assault became fierce, and even those troops which had been left in camp could not restrain themselves, but ran in throngs to help the assailants, and the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/333352PTyr' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://33.272,35.196'>Tyrians</a> gave up the fight. So <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> took the city on that day. 4 After this, as he was giving siege to <a about='https://topostext.org/place/315344UGaz' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://31.523,34.432'>Gaza</a>, the principal city of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/355390RSyr' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://35.5,39'>Syria</a>, a clod of earth, which had been dropped from on high by a bird, struck him on the shoulder. The bird alighted on one of the battering-engines, and was at once caught in the network of sinews which were used to give a twist to the ropes. 5 And the omen was fulfilled as <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1772" target="_blank">Aristander</a> predicted; for though <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> was wounded in the shoulder, he took the city. 6 Moreover, as he was dispatching great quantities of the spoils home to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=272" target="_blank">Olympias</a> and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=100" target="_blank">Cleopatra</a> and his friends, he sent also to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=212" target="_blank">Leonidas</a> his tutor five hundred talents' weight of frankincense and a hundred of myrrh, in remembrance of the hope which that teacher had inspired his boyhood. 7 It would seem, namely, that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=212" target="_blank">Leonidas</a>, as <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> was one day sacrificing and taking incense with both hands to throw upon the altar-fire, said to him: — '<a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, when thou hast conquered the spice-bearing regions thou canst be thus lavish with thine incense; now, however, use sparingly what thou hast.' 8 Accordingly, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> now wrote him: 'I have sent thee myrrh and frankincense in abundance, that thou mayest stop dealing parsimoniously with the gods.' </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:25' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

This is attested by many trustworthy authorities. 3 And if what the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/312299PAle' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://31.182,29.897'>Alexandrians</a> tell us on the authority of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=268" target="_blank">Heracleides</a> is true, then it would seem that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=9" target="_blank">Homer</a> was no idle or unprofitable companion for him in his expedition. 4 They say, namely, that after his conquest of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://27.1,30.7'>Egypt</a> he wished to found a large and populous Greek city which should bear his name, and by the advice of his architects was on the point of measuring off and enclosing a certain site for it. 5 Then, in the night, as he lay asleep, he saw a wonderful vision. A man with very hoary locks and of a venerable aspect appeared to stand by his side and recite these verses: — 'Now, there is an island in the much-dashing sea, In front of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/271307REgy' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://27.1,30.7'>Egypt</a>; <a about='https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://31.213,29.8856'>Pharos</a> is what men call it.' 6 Accordingly, he rose up at once and went to <a about='https://topostext.org/place/312299IPha' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://31.213,29.8856'>Pharos</a>, which at that time was still an island, a little above the Canobic mouth of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/312301WNil' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://30.0918,31.2313'>Nile</a>, but now it has been joined to the mainland by a causeway. 7 And when he saw a site of surpassing natural advantages (for it is a strip of land like enough to a broad isthmus, extending between a great lagoon and a stretch of sea which terminates in a large harbour), he said he saw now that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=9" target="_blank">Homer</a> was not only admirable in other ways, but also a very wise architect, and ordered the plan of the city to be drawn in conformity with this site. 8 There was no chalk at hand, so they took barley-meal and marked out with it on the dark soil a rounded area, to whose inner arc straight lines extended so as to produce the figure of a chlamys, or military cloak, the lines beginning from the skirts (as one may say), and narrowing the breadth of the area uniformly. The king was delighted with the design; but suddenly birds from the river and the lagoon, infinite in number and of every sort and size, settled down upon the place like clouds and devoured every particle of the barley-meal, so that even <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> was greatly disturbed at the omen. However, the seers exhorted him to be of good cheer, since the city here founded by him would have most abundant and helpful resources and be a nursing mother for men of every nation, and so he ordered those in charge of the work to proceed with it, while he himself set out for the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/292255SAmm' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.2052,25.5435'>temple of Ammon</a>. The journey thither was long, full of toils and hardships, and had two perils. One is the dearth of water, which leaves the traveller destitute of it for many days; the other arises when a fierce south wind smites men travelling in sand of boundless depth, as is said to have been the case with the army of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=214" target="_blank">Cambyses</a>, long ago; the wind raised great billows of sand all over the plain and buried up fifty thousand men, to their utter destruction. Almost all of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>'s followers took all these things into consideration, but it was difficult to turn him aside from any course so ever when he had once set out upon it. For <a href="/people_index.php?pid=36" target="_blank">Fortune</a>, by yielding to his onsets, was making his purpose obstinate, and the high spirit which he carried into his undertakings rendered his ambition finally invincible, so that it subdued not only enemies, but even times and places. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:26' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

Then <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> made splendid offerings to the god and gave his priests large gifts of money. 8 This is what most writers state regarding the oracular responses; but <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> himself, in a letter to his mother, says that he received certain secret responses, which he would tell to her, and to her alone, on his return. 9 And some say that the prophet, wishing to show his friendliness by addressing him with 'O paidion,' or O my son, in his foreign pronunciation ended the words with 's' instead of 'n,' and said, 'O paidios,' and that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> was pleased at the slip in pronunciation, and a story became current that the god had addressed him with 'O pai <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1654" target="_blank">Dios</a>,' or O son of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1" target="_blank">Zeus</a>.

Accordingly, he gave the woman a sumptuous burial. 2 One of the eunuchs of the bed-chamber who had been captured with the women, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10359" target="_blank">Teireos</a> by name, ran away from the camp, made his way on horseback to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a>, and told him of the death of his wife. 3 Then the king, beating upon his head and bursting into lamentation, said: 'Alas for the evil genius of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persians</a>, if the sister and wife of their king must not only become a captive in her life, but also in her death be deprived of royal burial.' 4 'Nay, O King,' answered the chamberlain, 'as regards her receiving every fitting honour, thou hast no charge to make against the evil genius of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persians</a>. 5 For neither did my mistress <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2260" target="_blank">Stateira</a>, while she lived, or thy mother or thy children, lack any of their former great blessings except the light of thy countenance, which Lord Oromazdes will cause to shine again with lustre; nor after her death was she deprived of any funeral adornment, nay, she was honoured with the tears of enemies. 6 For <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> is as gentle after victory as he is terrible in battle.' 7 When <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a> heard this, his agitation and grief swept him into absurd suspicions, and leading the eunuch away into a more secluded part of his tent, he said: 8 'If thou also, together with the fortune of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persians</a>, dost not side with the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a>, and if I, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a>, am still thy lord and master, tell me, as thou reverest the great light of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2244" target="_blank">Mithras</a> and the right hand of thy king, is it not the least of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2260" target="_blank">Stateira</a>'s misfortunes that I am now lamenting? While she was alive did I not suffer more painful evils? And would not my wretched fortune have been more compatible with my honour if I had met with an angry and savage enemy? 9 For what intercourse that is proper can a young man have with an enemy's wife when it leads to such marks of honour?' While the king was still speaking, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10359" target="_blank">Teireos</a> threw himself down at his feet and besought him to hold his peace, and neither to wrong <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, nor shame his dead sister and wife, nor rob himself of the greatest consolation for his disasters, namely, the belief that he had been conquered by a man who was superior to human nature; nay, he should even admire <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> for having shown greater self-restraint in dealing with <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persian</a> women than valour against <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persian</a> men.

The army were spectators of the combat, counting the issue as in some measure an omen of the future. 5 After a strenuous battle, the one called <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> was victorious, and received as a reward twelve villages and the right to wear <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persian</a> dress. This, at any rate, is what we are told by <a href="/people_index.php?pid=132" target="_blank">Eratosthenes</a>. 6 Now, the great battle against <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a> was not fought at <a about='https://topostext.org/place/362440UArb' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://36.191,44.009'>Arbela</a>, as most writers state, but at <a about='https://topostext.org/place/366435UGau' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://36.593,43.481'>Gaugamela</a>. 7 The word signifies, we are told, '<a href="/people_index.php?pid=10950" target="_blank">camel</a>'s house,' since one of the ancient kings of the country, after escaping from his enemies on a swift <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10950" target="_blank">camel</a>, gave the animal a home here, assigning certain villages and revenues for its maintenance. 8 It so happened that in the month Boedromion the moon suffered an eclipse, about the beginning of the Mysteries at <a about='https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.9718,23.72793'>Athens</a>, and on the eleventh night after the eclipse, the armies being now in sight of one another, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a> kept his forces under arms, and held a review of them by torch-light; 9 but <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, while his <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> slept, himself passed the night in front of his tent with his seer <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1772" target="_blank">Aristander</a>, celebrating certain mysterious sacred rites and sacrificing to the god Fear. Meanwhile the older of his companions, and particularly <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1334" target="_blank">Parmenio</a>, when they saw the plain between the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2431" target="_blank">Niphates</a> and the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/375433RGor' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.5,43.3'>Gordyaean</a> mountains all lighted up with the barbarian fires, while an indistinguishably mingled and tumultuous sound of voices arose from their camp as if from a vast ocean, were astonished at their multitude and argued with one another that it was a great and grievous task to repel such a tide of war by engaging in broad day-light. They therefore waited upon the king when he had finished his sacrifices, and tried to persuade him to attack the enemy by night, and so to cover up with darkness the most fearful aspect of the coming struggle. But he gave them the celebrated answer, 'I will not steal my victory'; whereupon some thought that he had made a vainglorious reply, and was jesting in the presence of so great a peril. Others, however, thought that he had confidence in the present situation and estimated the future correctly, not offering <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a> in case of defeat an excuse to pluck up courage for another attempt, by laying the blame this time upon darkness and night, as he had before upon mountains, defiles, and sea. For <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a> would not give up the war for lack of arms or men when he could draw from so great a host and so vast a territory, but only when he had lost courage and hope, under the conviction brought by a downright defeat in broad day-light. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:31' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

Therefore, too, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1334" target="_blank">Parmenio</a>, much disturbed by both occurrences, sent messengers to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> telling him that camp and baggage were gone, unless he speedily sent strong reinforcements from front to rear. 7 Now, it chanced that at that instant <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> was about to give the signal for the onset to those under his command; but when he heard <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1334" target="_blank">Parmenio</a>'s message, he declared that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1334" target="_blank">Parmenio</a> was beside himself and had lost the use of his reason, and had forgotten in his distress that victors add the baggage of the enemy to their own, and that those who are vanquished must not think about their wealth or their slaves, but only how they may fight gloriously and die with honour. 8 After sending this message to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1334" target="_blank">Parmenio</a>, he put on his helmet, but the rest of his armour he had on as he came from his tent, namely, a vest of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/376145RSic' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.6,14.5'>Sicilian</a> make girt about him, and over this a breastplate of two-ply linen from the spoils taken at <a about='https://topostext.org/place/368362UIss' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://36.752,36.216'>Issus</a>. 9 His helmet was of iron, but gleamed like polished silver, a work of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1209" target="_blank">Theophilus</a>; and there was fitted to this a gorget, likewise of iron, set with precious stones. He had a sword, too, of astonishing temper and lightness, a gift from the king of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/349336PKit' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://34.920211,33.632745'>Citieans</a>, and he had trained himself to use a sword for the most part in his battles.

For there is general complaint that in that battle <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1334" target="_blank">Parmenio</a> was sluggish and inefficient, either because old age was now impairing somewhat his courage, or because he was made envious and resentful by the arrogance and pomp, to use the words of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=342" target="_blank">Callisthenes</a>, of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>'s power. At the time, then, although he was annoyed by the summons, the king did not tell his soldiers the truth about it, but on the ground that it was dark and he would therefore remit further slaughter, sounded a recall; and as he rode towards the endangered portion of his army, he heard by the way that the enemy had been utterly defeated and was in flight. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:33' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

For if it should lay hold of him and not be extinguished, I would certainly say that its power was invincible and terrible.' 8 The youth also, strangely enough, offered himself for the experiment, and as soon as he touched the liquid and began to anoint himself with it, his body broke out into so great a flame and was so wholly possessed by fire that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> fell into extreme perplexity and fear; 9 and had it not been by chance that many were standing by holding vessels of water for the bath, the youth would have been consumed before aid reached him. Even as it was, they had great difficulty in putting out the fire, for it covered the boy's whole body, and after they had done so, he was in a sorry plight. It is natural, then, that some who wish to bring fable into conformity with truth should say that this naphtha is the drug which <a href="/people_index.php?pid=165" target="_blank">Medeia</a> used, when, in the tragedies, she anoints the crown and the robe. For it was not from these objects themselves, they say, nor of its own accord, that the fire shot up, but a flame was placed near them, which was then so swiftly drawn into conjunction with them that the sense could not take cognisance of it. For the rays and emanations of fire which come from a distance impart to some bodies merely light and warmth; but in those which are dry and porous, or which have sufficiently rich moisture, they collect themselves together, break into fierce flame, and transform the material. There has been much discussion about the origin of . . . . or whether rather the liquid substance that feeds the flame flows out from a soil which is rich and productive of fire. For the soil of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=471" target="_blank">Babylonia</a> is very fiery, so that grains of barley often leap out of the ground and bound away, as if its inflammation made the ground throb; and the inhabitants, during the hot season, sleep on skins filled with water. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=477" target="_blank">Harpalus</a>, moreover, when he was left as overseer of the country and was eager to adorn the royal gardens and walks with Hellenic plants, succeeded with all except ivy; this the soil would not support, but always killed it. The plant could not endure the temper of the soil, for the soil was fiery, while the plant was fond of coolness. However, if such digressions are kept within bounds, perhaps my impatient readers will find less fault with them. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:35' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

She, partly in graceful praise of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, and partly to make sport for him, as the drinking went on, was moved to utter a speech which befitted the character of her native country, but was too lofty for one of her kind. 3 She said, namely, that for all her hardships in wandering over Asia she was being requited that day by thus revelling luxuriously in the splendid palace of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persians</a>; 4 but it would be a still greater pleasure to go in revel rout and set fire to the house of the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=56" target="_blank">Xerxes</a> who burned <a about='https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.9718,23.72793'>Athens</a>, she herself kindling the fire under the eyes of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, in order that a tradition might prevail among men that the women in the train of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> inflicted a greater punishment upon the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/295540RPer' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://29.5,54'>Persians</a> in behalf of Hellas than all her famous commanders by sea and land. 5 As soon as she had thus spoken, tumultuous applause arose, and the companions of the king eagerly urged him on, so that he yielded to their desires, and leaping to his feet, with a garland on his head and a torch in his hand, led them the way. 6 The company followed with shouts and revelry and surrounded the palace, while the rest of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> who learned about it ran thither with torches and were full of joy. 7 For they hoped that the burning and destruction of the palace was the act of one who had fixed his thoughts on home, and did not intend to dwell among Barbarians. 8 This is the way the deed was done, according to some writers; but others say it was premeditated.

His gifts, too, were accompanied by a kindly spirit, with which alone, to tell the truth, a giver confers a favour. 2 I will mention a few instances. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=313" target="_blank">Ariston</a>, the captain of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/415220RPai' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://41.5,22.01'>Paeonians</a>, having slain an enemy, brought his head and showed it to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, saying: 'In my country, O King, such a gift as this is rewarded with a golden beaker.' 'Yes,' said <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> with a laugh, 'an empty one; but I will pledge thy health with one which is full of pure wine.' 3 Again, a common <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonian</a> was driving a mule laden with some of the royal gold, and when the beast gave out, took the load on his own shoulders and tried to carry it. The king, then, seeing the man in great distress and learning the facts of the case, said, as the man was about to lay his burden down, 'Don't give out, but finish your journey by taking this load to your own tent.' 4 Furthermore, he was generally more displeased with those who would not take his gifts than with those who asked for them. And so he wrote to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=182" target="_blank">Phocion</a> in a letter that he would not treat him as a friend in future if he rejected his favours. 5 Again, to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=3248" target="_blank">Serapion</a>, one of the youths who played at ball with him, he used to give nothing because he asked for nothing. Accordingly, whenever <a href="/people_index.php?pid=3248" target="_blank">Serapion</a> had the ball, he would throw it to others, until the king said: 'Won't you give it to me?' 'No,' said <a href="/people_index.php?pid=3248" target="_blank">Serapion</a>, 'because you don't ask for it,' whereat the king burst out laughing and made him many presents. 6 With <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2347" target="_blank">Proteas</a>, however, a clever wag and boon companion, he appeared to be angry; but when the man's friends begged his forgiveness, as did <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2347" target="_blank">Proteas</a> himself with tears, the king said he was his friend again, whereat <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2347" target="_blank">Proteas</a> said: 'In that case, O King, give me something to prove it first.' Accordingly, the king ordered that five talents should be given him. What lofty airs his friends and bodyguards were wont to display over the wealth bestowed by him, is plain from a letter which <a href="/people_index.php?pid=272" target="_blank">Olympias</a> wrote to him. She says: 'I beg thee to find other ways of conferring favours on those thou lovest and holdest in honour; as it is, thou makest them all the equals of kings and providest them with an abundance of friends, whilst thyself thou strippest bare.' 8 <a href="/people_index.php?pid=272" target="_blank">Olympias</a> often wrote him in like vein, but <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> kept her writings secret, except once when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a>, as was his wont, read with him a letter which had been opened; the king did not prevent him, but took the ring from his own finger and applied its seal to the lips of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a>. 9 Again, though the son of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=2170" target="_blank">Mazaeus</a>, the most influential man at the court of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a>, already had a province, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> gave him a second and a larger one. He, however, declined it, saying: 'O King, formerly there was one <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a>, but now thou has made many Alexanders.' To <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1334" target="_blank">Parmenio</a>, moreover, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> gave the house of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=957" target="_blank">Bagoas</a> at <a about='https://topostext.org/place/322482PSus' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://32.191,48.247'>Susa</a>, in which it is said that there was found apparel worth a thousand talents.

He found fault with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1899" target="_blank">Peucestas</a> by letter because, after being bitten by a bear, he wrote about it to the rest of his friends but did not tell him.

For instance, he wrote one giving orders to seek out a slave of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=72" target="_blank">Seleucus</a> who had run away into <a about='https://topostext.org/place/370340RCil' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.01,34.01'>Cilicia</a>; and one in commendation of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1899" target="_blank">Peucestas</a> for arresting <a href="/people_index.php?pid=12003" target="_blank">Nicon</a>, a servant of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a>; and one to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1023" target="_blank">Megabyzus</a> about an attendant who had taken refuge in a sanctuary, bidding him, if possible, entice the slave outside the sanctuary and then arrest him, but not to lay hands upon him in the sanctuary. 2 It is said, too, that at first, when he was trying capital cases, he would put his hand over one of his ears while the accuser was speaking, that he might keep it free and unprejudiced for the accused. 3 But afterwards the multitude of accusations which he heard rendered him harsh, and led him to believe the false because so many were true. 4 And particularly when he was maligned he lost discretion and was cruel and inexorable, since he loved his reputation more than his life or his kingdom. 5 Now, however, he marched out against <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a>, expecting to fight another battle; but when he heard that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a> had been seized by <a href="/people_index.php?pid=980" target="_blank">Bessus</a>, he sent his <a about='https://topostext.org/place/394223RThs' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://39.4,22.3'>Thessalians</a> home, after distributing among them a largess of two thousand talents over and above their pay. 6 In consequence of the pursuit of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a>, which was long and arduous (for in eleven days he rode thirty-three hundred furlongs), most of his horsemen gave out, and chiefly for lack of water. 7 At this point some <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> met him who were carrying water from the river in skins upon their mules. And when they beheld <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, it being now midday, in a wretched plight from thirst, they quickly filled a helmet and brought it to him. To his enquiry for whom they were carrying the water, they replied: 8 'For our own sons; but if thou livest, we can get other sons, even if we lose these.' 9 On hearing this he took the helmet into his hands, but when he looked around and saw the horsemen about him all stretching out their heads and gazing at the water, he handed it back without drinking any, but with praises for the men who had brought it; 'For,' said he, 'if I should drink of it alone, these horsemen of mine will be out of heart.' But they beheld his self-control and loftiness of spirit, and began to goad their <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horses</a> on, declaring that they would not regard themselves as weary, or thirsty, or as mortals at all, so long as they had such a king. 3 So, then, all were alike ready and willing; but only sixty, they say, were with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> when he burst into the camp of the enemy. 2 There, indeed, they rode over much gold and silver that was thrown away, passed by many waggons full of women and children which were coursing hither and thither without their drivers, and pursued those who were foremost in flight, thinking that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a> was among them. 3 But at last they found him lying in a waggon, his body all full of javelins, at the point of death. Nevertheless, he asked for something to drink, and when he had drunk some cold water which <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1516" target="_blank">Polystratus</a> gave him, he said to him: 4 'My man, this is the extremity of my ill-fortune, that I receive good at thy hands and am not able to return it; but <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> will requite thee for thy good offices, and the gods will reward <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> for his kindness to my mother, wife, and children; to him, through thee, I give this right hand.' With these words he took the hand of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1516" target="_blank">Polystratus</a> and then expired. 5 When <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> came up, he was manifestly distressed by what had happened, and unfastening his own cloak threw it upon the body and covered it. 6 And when, at a later time, he found <a href="/people_index.php?pid=980" target="_blank">Bessus</a>, he had him rent asunder. Two straight trees were bent together and a part of his body fastened to each; then when each was released and sprang vigorously back, the part of the body that was attached to it followed after. 7 Now, however, he sent the body of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=29" target="_blank">Dareius</a>, laid out in royal state, to his mother, and admitted his brother, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=7689" target="_blank">Exathres</a>, into the number of his companions. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:42' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

And in general he showed most affection for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a>, but most esteem for <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a>, thinking, and constantly saying, that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a> was a friend of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, but <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a> a friend of the king. For this reason, too, the men cherished a secret grudge against one another and often came into open collision. And once, on the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://30,74'>Indian</a> expedition, they actually drew their swords and closed with one another, and as the friends of each were coming to his aid, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> rode up and abused <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a> publicly, calling him a fool and a madman for not knowing that without <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>'s favour he was nothing; and in private he also sharply reproved <a href="/people_index.php?pid=341" target="_blank">Craterus</a>. Then he brought them together and reconciled them, taking an oath by <a href="/people_index.php?pid=577" target="_blank">Ammon</a> and the rest of the gods that he loved them most of all men; but that if he heard of their quarreling again, he would kill them both, or at least the one who began the quarrel.

Moreover, for a very long time accusations against himself had been brought to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> himself.

And he refused their request twice. 6 They now became suspicious of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=591" target="_blank">Philotas</a> and applied to someone else, by whom they were brought before <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>. In the first place they told him about the plot of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=5750" target="_blank">Limnus</a>, and then threw out veiled insinuations against <a href="/people_index.php?pid=591" target="_blank">Philotas</a>, on the ground that he had neglected their petitions on two occasions. 7 This greatly incensed <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>; and when he found that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=5750" target="_blank">Limnus</a> had defended himself against arrest and had therefore been killed by the man sent to fetch him, he was still more disturbed in mind, thinking that the proof of the plot had escaped him. And since he felt bitter towards <a href="/people_index.php?pid=591" target="_blank">Philotas</a> he drew to himself those who had long hated the man, and they now said openly that the king took things too easily when he supposed that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=5750" target="_blank">Limnus</a>, a man of Chalaestra, had set his hand to a deed of so great daring on his own account; 9 nay, they said, he was only an assistant, or rather an instrument sent forth by a higher power, and enquiry into the plot should be made in those quarters where there was most interest in having it concealed. After the king had once given ear to such speeches and suspicions, the enemies of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=591" target="_blank">Philotas</a> brought up countless accusations against him. Consequently he was arrested and put to the question, the companions of the king standing by at the torture, while <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> himself listened behind a stretch of tapestry. Here, as we are told, on hearing <a href="/people_index.php?pid=591" target="_blank">Philotas</a> beset <a href="/people_index.php?pid=355" target="_blank">Hephaestion</a> with abject cries and supplications, he said: 'So faint-hearted thou art, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=591" target="_blank">Philotas</a>, and so unmanly, couldst thou have set hand to so great an undertaking?' After <a href="/people_index.php?pid=591" target="_blank">Philotas</a> had been put to death, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> sent at once into <a about='https://topostext.org/place/355480RMed' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://35.5,48'>Media</a> and dispatched <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1334" target="_blank">Parmenio</a> also, a man whose achievements with <a href="/people_index.php?pid=30" target="_blank">Philip</a> had been many, and who was the only one of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>'s older friends, or the principal one, to urge his crossing into Asia, and who, of the three sons that were his, had seen two killed on the expedition before this, and was now put to death along with the third. These actions made <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> an object of fear to many of his friends, and particularly to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=74" target="_blank">Antipater</a>, who sent secretly to the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/386215RAit' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://38.6,21.5'>Aitolians</a> and entered into an alliance with them.

            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047:50'><b>&sect; 50</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long afterwards came the affair of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1287" target="_blank">Cleitus</a>, which those who simply learn the immediate circumstances will think more savage than that of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=591" target="_blank">Philotas</a>; 2 if we take into consideration, however, alike the cause and the time, we find that it did not happen of set purpose, but through some misfortune of the king, whose anger and intoxication furnished occasion for the evil genius of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1287" target="_blank">Cleitus</a>. It happened on this wise. 3 Some people came bringing Greek fruit to the king from the sea-board. He admired its perfection and beauty and called <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1287" target="_blank">Cleitus</a>, wishing to show it to him and share it with him. 4 It chanced that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1287" target="_blank">Cleitus</a> was sacrificing, but he gave up the sacrifice and came; and three of the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10954" target="_blank">sheep</a> on which libations had already been poured came following after him. 5 When the king learned of this circumstance, he imparted it to his soothsayers, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1772" target="_blank">Aristander</a> and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=4487" target="_blank">Cleomantis</a> the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/371224PSpa' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.0821,22.4237'>Lacedemonian</a>. Then, on their telling him that the omen was bad, he ordered them to sacrifice in all haste for the safety of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1287" target="_blank">Cleitus</a>. 6 For he himself, two days before this, had seen a strange vision in his sleep; he thought he saw <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1287" target="_blank">Cleitus</a> sitting with the sons of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1334" target="_blank">Parmenio</a> in black robes, and all were dead. 7 However, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1287" target="_blank">Cleitus</a> did not finish his sacrifice, but came at once to the supper of the king, who had sacrificed to the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=526" target="_blank">Dioscuri</a>. 8 After boisterous drinking was under way, verses were sung which had been composed by a certain Pranichus, or, as some say, Pierio, to shame and ridicule the generals who had lately been defeated by the Barbarians. 9 The older guests were annoyed at this and railed at both the poet and the singer, but <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> and those about him listened with delight and bade the singer go on. Then <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1287" target="_blank">Cleitus</a>, who was already drunk and naturally of a harsh temper and wilful, was more than ever vexed, and insisted that it was not well done, when among Barbarians and enemies, to insult <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> who were far better men than those who laughed at them, even though they had met with misfortune.

Then <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, no longer able to restrain his anger, threw one of the apples that lay on the table at <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1287" target="_blank">Cleitus</a> and hit him, and began looking about for his sword. 6 But one of his body-guards, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=73" target="_blank">Aristophanes</a>, conveyed it away before he could lay his hands on it, and the rest surrounded him and begged him to desist, whereupon he sprang to his feet and called out in <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonian</a> speech a summons to his corps of guards (and this was a sign of great disturbance), and ordered the trumpeter to sound, and smote him with his fist because he hesitated and was unwilling to do so. 7 This man, then, was afterwards held in high esteem on the ground that it was due to him more than to any one else that the camp was not thrown into commotion. 8 But <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1287" target="_blank">Cleitus</a> would not give in, and with much ado his friends pushed him out of the banquet-hall.

For it gave annoyance to a few only of the soldiers, while the most of them, with rapturous shouts and war-cries, shared their necessaries with those who were in need of them, and what was superfluous they burned and destroyed with their own hands, thus filling <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> with zeal and eagerness. 3 Besides, he was already greatly feared, and inexorable in the chastisement of a transgressor. For instance, when a certain <a href="/people_index.php?pid=156" target="_blank">Menander</a>, one of his companions, who had been put in command of a garrison, refused to remain there, he put him to death; and Orsodates, a Barbarian who had revolted from him, he shot down with his own hand. 4 When a <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10954" target="_blank">sheep</a> yeaned a <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10954" target="_blank">lamb</a> which had upon its head what looked like a tiara in form and colour, with testicles on either side of it, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> was filled with loathing at the portent, and had himself purified by the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/325444UBab' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://32.542,44.421'>Babylonians</a>, whom he was accustomed to take along with him for such purposes; and in conversation with his friends he said that he was not disturbed for his own sake, but for theirs, fearing lest after his death Heaven might devolve his power upon an ignoble and impotent man. 5 However, a better portent occurred and put an end to his dejection.

Therefore, after he had made a truce with them in a certain city and allowed them to depart, he fell upon them as they marched and slew them all. 7 And this act adheres like a stain to his military career; in all other instances he waged war according to usage and like a king. 8 The philosophers, too, no less than the mercenaries, gave him trouble, by abusing those of the native princes who attached themselves to his cause, and by inciting the free peoples to revolt. He therefore took many of these also and hanged them. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:59' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

            <p id='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047:60'><b>&sect; 60</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his campaign against <a href="/people_index.php?pid=415" target="_blank">Porus</a> he himself has given an account in his letters. He says, namely, that the river <a href="/people_index.php?pid=216" target="_blank">Hydaspes</a> flowed between the two camps, and that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=415" target="_blank">Porus</a> stationed his elephants on the opposite bank and kept continual watch of the crossing. 2 He himself, accordingly, day by day caused a great din and tumult to be made in his camp, and thereby accustomed the Barbarians not to be alarmed. 3 Then, on a dark and stormy night, he took a part of his infantry and the best of his horsemen, and after proceeding along the river to a distance from where the enemy lay, crossed over to a small island. 4 Here rain fell in torrents, and many tornadoes and thunder-bolts dashed down upon his men; but nevertheless, although he saw that many of them were being burned to death by the thunder-bolts, he set out from the islet and made for the opposite banks. 5 But the <a href="/people_index.php?pid=216" target="_blank">Hydaspes</a>, made violent by the storm and dashing high against its bank, made a great breach in it, and a large part of the stream was setting in that direction; and the shore between the two currents gave his men no sure footing, since it was broken and slippery. 6 And here it was that he is said to have cried: 'O <a about='https://topostext.org/place/380237PAth' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.9718,23.72793'>Athenians</a>, can ye possibly believe what perils I am undergoing to win glory in your eyes?' 7 This, however, is the story of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=936" target="_blank">Onesicritus</a>; <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> himself says that they left their rafts and crossed the breach with their armour on, wading breast-high in water, and that after he had crossed he led his horsemen twenty furlongs in advance of his infantry, calculating that, in case the enemy attacked with their cavalry, he would be far superior to them, and in case they moved up their men-at arms, his infantry would join him in good season. And one of these suppositions came to pass. 8 For after routing a thousand of the enemy's horsemen and sixty of their chariots which engaged him, he captured all the chariots, and slew four hundred of the horsemen. 9 And now <a href="/people_index.php?pid=415" target="_blank">Porus</a>, thus led to believe that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> himself had crossed the river, advanced upon him with all his forces, except the part he left behind to impede the crossing of the remaining <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a>. But <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a>, fearing the elephants and the great numbers of the enemy, himself assaulted their left wing, and ordered <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1169" target="_blank">Coenus</a> to attack their right. Both wings having been routed, the vanquished troops retired in every case upon the elephants in the centre, and were there crowded together with them, and from this point on the battle was waged at close quarters, and it was not until the eighth hour that the enemy gave up. Such then, is the account of the battle which the victor himself has given in his letters. Most historians agree that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=415" target="_blank">Porus</a> was four cubits and a span high, and that the size and majesty of his body made his elephant seem as fitting a mount for him as a <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10959" target="_blank">horse</a> for the horseman. And yet his elephant was of the largest size; and it showed remarkable intelligence and solicitude for the king, bravely defending him and beating back his assailants while he was still in full vigour, and when it perceived that its master was worn out with a multitude of missiles and wounds, fearing he should fall off, it knelt softly on the ground, and with its proboscis gently took each spear and drew it out of his body. <a href="/people_index.php?pid=415" target="_blank">Porus</a> was taken prisoner, and when <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> asked him how he would be treated, said: 'Like a king'; and to another question from <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> whether he had anything else to say, replied: 'All things are included in my 'like a king.' ' Accordingly, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> not only permitted him to govern his former kingdom, giving him the title of satrap, but also added to it the territory of the independent peoples whom he subdued, in which there are said to have been fifteen nations, five thousand cities of considerable size, and a great multitude of villages. He subdued other territory also thrice as large as this and appointed <a href="/people_index.php?pid=26" target="_blank">Philip</a>, one of his companions, satrap over it. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:60' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

Moreover, he erected altars for the gods, 8 which down to the present time are revered by the kings of the Praesii when they cross the river, and on them they offer sacrifices in the Hellenic manner. 9 <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6210" target="_blank">Androcottus</a>, when he was a stripling, saw <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> himself, and we are told that he often said in later times that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> narrowly missed making himself master of the country, since its king was hated and despised on account of his baseness and low birth. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:62' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

However, in attacking the people called <a href="/people_index.php?pid=4597" target="_blank">Malli</a>, who are said to have been the most warlike of the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/300740RInd' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://30,74'>Indians</a>, he came within a little of being cut down. 3 For after dispersing the inhabitants from the walls with missiles, he was the first to mount upon the wall by a scaling ladder, and since the ladder was broken to pieces and he was exposed to the missiles of the Barbarians who stood along the wall below, almost alone as he was, he crouched and threw himself into the midst of the enemy, and by good fortune alighted on his feet. 4 Then, as he brandished his arms, the Barbarians thought that a shape of gleaming fire played in front of his person. 5 Therefore at first they scattered and fled; but when they saw that he was accompanied by only two of his guards, they ran upon him, and some tried to wound him by thrusting their swords and spears through his armour as he defended himself, 6 while one, standing a little further off, shot an arrow at him with such accuracy and force that it cut its way through his breastplate and fastened itself in his ribs at the breast. 7 Such was the force of the blow that <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> recoiled and sank to his knees, whereupon his assailant ran at him with drawn scimitar, while <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1899" target="_blank">Peucestas</a> and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=4584" target="_blank">Limnaeus</a> defended him. 8 Both of them were wounded, and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=4584" target="_blank">Limnaeus</a> was killed; but <a href="/people_index.php?pid=1899" target="_blank">Peucestas</a> held out, and at last <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> killed the Barbarian. 9 But he himself received many wounds, and at last was smitten on the neck with a cudgel, and leaned against the wall, his eyes still fixed upon his foes.

And straightway a report that he was dead prevailed in the camp; but when with much difficulty and pains they had sawn off the shaft of the arrow, which was of wood, and had thus succeeded at last in removing the king's breastplate, they came to the excision of the arrow-head, which was buried in one of the ribs. We are told, moreover, that it was three fingers broad and four long. Its removal, therefore, threw the king into swoons and brought him to death's door, but nevertheless he recovered. And after he was out of danger, though he was still weak and kept himself for a long time under regimen and treatment, perceiving from their tumult at his door that his <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> were yearning to see him, he took his cloak and went out to them.

For instance, the largest and handsomest <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10960" target="_blank">lion</a> in his menagerie was attacked by a tame <a href="/people_index.php?pid=10962" target="_blank">ass</a> and kicked to death. 7 Again, he once took off his clothes for exercise and was playing ball, and when it was time to dress again, the young men who were playing with him beheld a man seated on the king's throne, in silence, wearing the royal diadem and robes. 8 When the man was asked who he was, he was speechless for a long time; but at last he came to his senses and said that his name was <a href="/people_index.php?pid=23" target="_blank">Dionysius</a>, and that he was a native of <a about='https://topostext.org/place/372218RMes' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://37.2,21.8'>Messenia</a>; in consequence of some charge brought against him, he said, he had been brought thither from the sea-board, and for a long time had been in chains; 9 but just now the god <a href="/people_index.php?pid=646" target="_blank">Serapis</a> had come to him and loosed his chains and brought him to this spot, bidding him put on the robe and diadem and sit on the throne and hold his peace. </p><p style='margin-top:-12px; text-align:right;'><i> Event Date: -350</i> <a href='http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg047.perseus-grc1:73' target='_blank'>GR</a> </p>        </div>

Then, when it was late, he took a bath, performed his sacrifices to the gods, ate a little, and had a fever through the night. 3 On the twentieth, after bathing again, he performed his customary sacrifice; and lying in the bathing-room he devoted himself to <a href="/people_index.php?pid=601" target="_blank">Nearchus</a>, listening to his story of his voyage and of the great sea. 4 The twenty-first he spent in the same way and was still more inflamed, and during the night he was in a grievous plight, and all the following day his fever was very high. 5 So he had his bed removed and lay by the side of the great bath, where he conversed with his officers about the vacant posts in the army, and how they might be filled with experienced men. 6 On the twenty-fourth his fever was violent and he had to be carried forth to perform his sacrifices; moreover, he ordered his principal officers to tarry in the court of the palace, and the commanders of divisions and companies to spend the night outside. 7 He was carried to the palace on the other side of the river on the twenty-fifth, and got a little sleep, but his fever did not abate. And when his commanders came to his bedside, he was speechless, as he was also on the twenty-sixth; 8 therefore the <a about='https://topostext.org/place/408225RMak' property='lawd:Place' id='didtap://40.81,22.5'>Macedonians</a> made up their minds that he was dead, and came with loud shouts to the doors of the palace, and threatened his companions until all opposition was broken down; and when the doors had been thrown open to them, without cloak or armour, one by one, they all filed slowly past his couch. 9 During this day, too, <a href="/people_index.php?pid=826" target="_blank">Python</a> and <a href="/people_index.php?pid=72" target="_blank">Seleucus</a> were sent to the temple of <a href="/people_index.php?pid=646" target="_blank">Serapis</a> to enquire whether they should bring <a href="/people_index.php?pid=6" target="_blank">Alexander</a> thither; and the god gave answer that they should leave him where he was.
