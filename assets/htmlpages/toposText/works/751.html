Morley (1992- ) shared under a (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) licence. <br> The particulars of Avienus's life remain unclear, but he is generally thought to have been writing around the fourth century AD. Traditional scholarship identified him with an Avienus who was proconsul in Africa and Achaea in the latter half of that century, though this is only a conjecture. The text of this didactic poem survived in poor condition. It is of scholarly interest because it seems to preserve names of peoples and Greek settlements on the coast of Iberia and Gaul from early writers, now lost. <br>
